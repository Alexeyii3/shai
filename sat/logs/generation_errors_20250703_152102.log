B: 200 pages for \\$25, 500 pages for \\$40$. Slope of B: $(40-25)/(500-200) = 15/300 = 0.05$. Intercept of B: $25 = 0.05(200) + b \\Rightarrow 25=10+b \\Rightarrow b=15$. So $C_A(p) = 0.08p+15$ and $C_B(p) = 0.05p+15$. Set equal: $0.08p+15=0.05p+15 \\Rightarrow 0.03p = 0 \\Rightarrow p=0$. Not a good problem. Let's try again. A: $C_A(p) = 0.10p+10$. B: 100 pages for \\$18, 300 pages for \\$34$. Slope B: $(34-18)/(300-100) = 16/200 = 0.08$. Intercept B: $18=0.08(100)+b \\Rightarrow 18=8+b \\Rightarrow b=10$. So $C_B(p) = 0.08p+10$.

Set $0.10p+20 = 0.05p+35$. $0.05p = 15 \\Rightarrow p = 300$. This is a good problem setup. OK, writing the solution for this version. Step 1: Find eq for B. Given pts (100, 40) and (300, 50). Step 2: Slope m=(50-40)/(300-100)=10/200=0.05. Step 3: Find b. $40=0.05(100)+b \\Rightarrow 40=5+b \\Rightarrow b=35$. Eq for B is $C_B(p)=0.05p+35$. Step 4: Set costs equal. $C_A(p)=C_B(p) \\Rightarrow 0.10p+20 = 0.05p+35$. Step 5: Solve for p. $0.05p = 15$. Step 6: $p = 15/0.05 = 300$. OK, this is THE final version. "Service A: $C_A(p) = 0.10p + 20$. Service B: 100 pages for \\$55, 300 pages for \\$65$. Find p where costs are equal.". Slope B: (65-55)/(300-100) = 10/200 = 0.05. Intercept B: $55 = 0.05(100)+b \\Rightarrow 55=5+b \\Rightarrow b=50$. OK. Equate: $0.10p+20 = 0.05p+50 \\Rightarrow 0.05p = 30 \\Rightarrow p = 600$. This works well. Let's use this. "Service A: $C_A(p) = 0.10p + 20$. Service B: 100 pages for \\$55, and 300 pages for \\$65$". Final answer is 600.

B: 200 pages for \\$25, 500 pages for \\$40$. Slope of B: $(40-25)/(500-200) = 15/300 = 0.05$. Intercept of B: $25 = 0.05(200) + b \\Rightarrow 25=10+b \\Rightarrow b=15$.

Set $0.10p+20 = 0.05p+35$. $0.05p = 15 \\Rightarrow p = 300$. This is a good problem setup. OK, writing the solution for this version. Step 1: Find eq for B. Given pts (100, 40) and (300, 50). Step 2: Slope m=(50-40)/(300-100)=10/200=0.05. Step 3: Find b. $40=0.05(100)+b \\Rightarrow 40=5+b \\Rightarrow b=35$. Eq for B is $C_B(p)=0.05p+35$. Step 4: Set costs equal. $C_A(p)=C_B(p) \\Rightarrow 0.10p+20 = 0.05p+35$. Step 5: Solve for p. $0.05p = 15$. Step 6: $p = 15/0.05 = 300$. OK, this is THE final version. "Service A: $C_A(p) = 0.10p + 20$. Service B: 100 pages for \\$55, 300 pages for \\$65$. Find p where costs are equal.". Slope B: (65-55)/(300-100) = 10/200 = 0.05. Intercept B: $55 = 0.05(100)+b \\Rightarrow 55=5+b \\Rightarrow b=50$. OK. Equate: $0.10p+20 = 0.05p+50 \\Rightarrow 0.05p = 30 \\Rightarrow p = 600$. This works well. Let's use this. "Service A: $C_A(p) = 0.10p + 20$. Service B: 100 pages for \\$55, and 300 pages for \\$65$". Final answer is 600.

This gives $5x = 22$, so $x = \\frac{22}{5} = 4.4$. Let me re-read the prompt. `f(x-2) = f(x) - 10`. So `f(x) - f(x-2) = 10`. The change in x is `x - (x-2) = 2`. The change in y is 10. `m = 10/2 = 5`. `f(x) = 5x+b`. `f(5)=3 => 3 = 5(5)+b => b = -22`. `f(x)=5x-22`. x-intercept is `5x-22=0 => x=22/5 = 4.4`. This is correct. Let me change the numbers to get a different result. `f(x-2) = f(x) - 10` is too similar to the `f(x+2)=f(x)+10` in the DO NOT REPEAT list, which gives m=5. Let's do `f(x+3) = f(x) - 6`. `f(x+3)-f(x) = -6`. `m = -6/3 = -2`. If `f(5)=3`, then `f(x)=-2x+b`. `3 = -2(5)+b => 3=-10+b => b=13`. So `f(x)=-2x+13`. x-intercept: `-2x+13=0 => 2x=13 => x=6.5`. This is a good variant. OK let's use this one.
