The angle $z$ and the bottom-right exterior angle ($150^{\circ}$) are supplementary because they are consecutive exterior angles. Oh, that's too complex for easy. Let's use simpler relations.","Correct Approach: The exterior angle $150^{\circ}$ (bottom-right) and the interior angle at the same vertex (bottom-right) are a linear pair. Let's call the interior angle $A$. $A=180-150=30^{\circ}$. This angle $A$ and the angle $x$ are alternate exterior and alternate interior, not directly related. Let's find the angle corresponding to angle $x$. The top-left interior angle corresponds to angle $x$'s position. Let's call the bottom-left exterior angle $B$. By corresponding angles, $x=B$. $B$ and the $150^{\circ}$ angle are a linear pair on line $k$. So $B+150=180$, which gives $B=30$. Therefore, $x=30$."
