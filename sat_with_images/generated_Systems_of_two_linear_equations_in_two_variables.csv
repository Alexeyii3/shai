Two solid black lines are graphed. Line 1 passes through the origin (0, 0) and the point (4, 4). Line 2 passes through the y-intercept (0, 8) and the point (4, 4). The lines intersect at (4, 4).",,,,,4,4,"The solution $(x,y)$ of the system is the point of intersection of the two lines.",We locate this point on the provided graph.,"The two lines intersect at the point $(4, 4)$.",The question asks for the value of $y$.,"From the solution point $(4, 4)$, the y-value is 4.",
