The probability of a website having a Stage 2 alert is the sum of the probabilities of having a Stage 2 alert on Farm A and having a Stage 2 alert on Farm B. This is the law of total probability. First, let's find the probability of a Stage 2 alert for each farm.","For Farm A, the probability of both alerts occurring is $P(S_2 \text{ and } A) = P(S_2 | S_1 \text{ and } A) \times P(S_1 | A) \times P(A)$. So, $P(S_2 \text{ and } A) = 0.80 \times 0.05 \times 0.60 = 0.04 \times 0.60 = 0.024$.","For Farm B, the probability of both alerts occurring is $P(S_2 \text{ and } B) = P(S_2 | S_1 \text{ and } B) \times P(S_1 | B) \times P(B)$. So, $P(S_2 \text{ and } B) = 0.60 \times 0.10 \times 0.40 = 0.06 \times 0.40 = 0.024$.","The overall probability of a Stage 2 alert, $P(S_2)$, is the sum of the probabilities from both farms: $P(S_2) = P(S_2 \text{ and } A) + P(S_2 \text{ and } B) = 0.024 + 0.024 = 0.048$.","We want to find the probability that a website is on Farm B given a Stage 2 alert, which is $P(B|S_2)$. Using the formula for conditional probability, $P(B|S_2) = \frac{P(B \text{ and } S_2)}{P(S_2)}$. We calculated both of these values. $P(B|S_2) = \frac{0.024}{0.048} = \frac{1}{2}$. Oops, let me recheck the calculation. Step 4: $0.60 \times 0.10 \times 0.40 = 0.024$. Step 3: $0.80 \times 0.05 \times 0.60 = 0.024$. The probabilities are identical. Let's adjust the problem values to make it more interesting. Let's change $P(S_1|B)$ to '0.15'. New calculations: Step 4: $P(S_2 \text{ and } B) = 0.60 \times 0.15 \times 0.40 = 0.09 \times 0.40 = 0.036$. Step 5: $P(S_2) = 0.024 + 0.036 = 0.060$. Step 6: $P(B|S_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.060} = \frac{36}{60} = \frac{3}{5}$. This is a better problem. Let's update the figure and solution. The original table now has P(S1 Alert | B) = 0.15. Question: ...If a randomly selected website has triggered a Stage 2 alert, what is the probability that the website is hosted on Farm B? Figure: B has 0.15 for P(Stage 1 Alert). Solution path: $P(S_2 \text{ and } A) = 0.80 \times 0.05 \times 0.60 = 0.024$. $P(S_2 \text{ and } B) = 0.60 \times 0.15 \times 0.40 = 0.036$. $P(S_2) = 0.024 + 0.036 = 0.060$. $P(B|S_2) = \frac{0.036}{0.060} = \frac{36}{60} = \frac{3}{5}$. The answer is 3/5 or 0.6."
