# Concurrent Math Task Generator with Figure Descriptions

Enhanced version of the math task generator that includes **detailed figure descriptions** for visual mathematical content.

## üéØ **Key Features**

### **Enhanced Visual Content Generation**
- **Detailed Figure Descriptions**: Generates comprehensive descriptions of graphs, tables, diagrams, and visual elements
- **Mathematical Precision**: Includes coordinate systems, axis ranges, key points, and visual details
- **Educational Clarity**: Descriptions help understand mathematical content without seeing the actual figure

### **Figure Description Examples**
The generator creates detailed descriptions like:

```
"Graph of two intersecting lines in the xy-plane. Line 1 passes through points (-2, 4) and (3, -1) with negative slope. Line 2 passes through points (0, 2) and (4, 6) with positive slope. Intersection point at (1, 3). X-axis ranges from -5 to 5, Y-axis ranges from -3 to 7, with unit grid."
```

```
"Table with 5 rows and 3 columns. Headers: 'Time (hours)', 'Distance (miles)', 'Speed (mph)'. Data shows increasing time from 1 to 4 hours, corresponding distances from 45 to 180 miles, and constant speed of 45 mph."
```

## üìÅ **Files Structure**

```

## üé® **Figure Description Types**

### **1. Graph-Based Problems**
```
"Graph of a quadratic function f(x) = x¬≤ - 4x + 3 in the xy-plane. Parabola opens upward with vertex at (2, -1). X-intercepts at (1, 0) and (3, 0). Y-intercept at (0, 3). X-axis ranges from -1 to 5, Y-axis ranges from -3 to 5, with gridlines at unit intervals."
```

### **2. Table-Based Problems**
```
"Table with 4 rows and 2 columns showing linear relationship. Column headers: 'x' and 'y'. Data points: (0, 5), (2, 11), (4, 17), (6, 23). Each y-value increases by 6 when x increases by 2, showing constant rate of change of 3."
```

### **3. Geometric Figures**
```
"Right triangle DEF with right angle at vertex E. Hypotenuse DF = 15 units, leg DE = 9 units, leg EF = 12 units. Angle D measures 37¬∞, angle F measures 53¬∞. Triangle positioned with DE horizontal and EF vertical."
```

### **4. System of Equations**
```
"Graph showing system of two linear equations in xy-plane. Line 1: y = 2x + 1 (slope = 2, y-intercept = 1). Line 2: y = -x + 4 (slope = -1, y-intercept = 4). Lines intersect at point (1, 3). Coordinate plane with x-axis from -2 to 6, y-axis from -1 to 7."
```

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

1. **Missing Figure Descriptions**
   - Check prompt requirements
   - Verify AI model response parsing
   - Ensure field validation is working

2. **LaTeX Formatting Issues**
   - Review JSON escaping in responses
   - Check mathematical notation cleaning
   - Validate LaTeX syntax

3. **CSV Structure Problems**
   - Verify column order matches input
   - Check field processing function
   - Ensure all required fields are populated

### **Debug Mode**
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```python
TEST_MODE = True
TEST_TASKS = 5
```

This generates a small sample for verification before full production runs.
