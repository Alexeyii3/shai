A line in the xy-plane that passes through the points x1,y1 and x2,y2 has slope m, where m=y2-y1x2-x1, and can be defined by an equation of the form y-y1=mx-x1. One of the lines shown in the graph passes through the points 8,0 and 3,4. Substituting 8 for x1, 0 for y1, 3 for x2, and 4 for y2 in the equation m=y2-y1x2-x1 yields m=4-03-8, or m=-45. Substituting -45 for m, 8 for x1 and 0 for y1 in the equation y-y1=mx-x1 yields y-0=-45x-8, which is equivalent to y=-45x+325. Adding 45x to both sides of this equation yields 45x+y=325. Multiplying both sides of this equation by -10 yields -8x-10y=-64. Therefore, an equation of this line is -8x-10y=-64. Similarly, the other line shown in the graph passes through the points 8,0 and 3,2. Substituting 8 for x1, 0 for y1, 3 for x2, and 2 for y2 in the equation m=y2-y1x2-x1 yields m=2-03-8, or m=-25. Substituting -25 for m, 8 for x1, and 0 for y1 in the equation y-y1=mx-x1 yields y-0=-25x-8, which is equivalent to y=-25x+165. Adding 25x to both sides of this equation yields 25x+y=165. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 10 yields 4x+10y=32. Therefore, an equation of this line is 4x+10y=32. So, the system of linear equations represented by the lines shown is 4x+10y=32 and -8x-10y=-64. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.","Choice D is correct. A line in the xy-plane that passes through the points $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$ has slope $m$, where $m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$, and can be defined by an equation of the form $y - y_{1} = m \left(x - x_{1}\right)$. One of the lines shown in the graph passes through the points $\left(8 , 0\right)$ and $\left(3 , 4\right)$. Substituting $8$ for $x_{1}$, $0$ for $y_{1}$, $3$ for $x_{2}$, and $4$ for $y_{2}$ in the equation $m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$ yields $m = \frac{4 - 0}{3 - 8}$, or $m = - \frac{4}{5}$. Substituting $- \frac{4}{5}$ for $m$, $8$ for $x_{1}$ and $0$ for $y_{1}$ in the equation $y - y_{1} = m \left(x - x_{1}\right)$ yields $y - 0 = - \frac{4}{5} \left(x - 8\right)$, which is equivalent to $y = - \frac{4}{5} x + \frac{32}{5}$. Adding $\frac{4}{5} x$ to both sides of this equation yields $\frac{4}{5} x + y = \frac{32}{5}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $- 10$ yields $- 8 x - 10 y = - 64$. Therefore, an equation of this line is $- 8 x - 10 y = - 64$. Similarly, the other line shown in the graph passes through the points $\left(8 , 0\right)$ and $\left(3 , 2\right)$. Substituting $8$ for $x_{1}$, $0$ for $y_{1}$, $3$ for $x_{2}$, and $2$ for $y_{2}$ in the equation $m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$ yields $m = \frac{2 - 0}{3 - 8}$, or $m = - \frac{2}{5}$. Substituting $- \frac{2}{5}$ for $m$, $8$ for $x_{1}$, and $0$ for $y_{1}$ in the equation $y - y_{1} = m \left(x - x_{1}\right)$ yields $y - 0 = - \frac{2}{5} \left(x - 8\right)$, which is equivalent to $y = - \frac{2}{5} x + \frac{16}{5}$. Adding $\frac{2}{5} x$ to both sides of this equation yields $\frac{2}{5} x + y = \frac{16}{5}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $10$ yields $4 x + 10 y = 32$. Therefore, an equation of this line is $4 x + 10 y = 32$. So, the system of linear equations represented by the lines shown is $4 x + 10 y = 32$ and $- 8 x - 10 y = - 64$.

It’s given in the table that the coordinates of two points on a line in the xy-plane are (k,13) and (k+7,-15). The y-intercept is another point on the line. The slope computed using any pair of points from the line will be the same. The slope of a line, m, between any two points, x1,y1 and x2,y2, on the line can be calculated using the slope formula, m=y2-y1x2-x1. It follows that the slope of the line with the given points from the table, (k,13) and (k+7,-15), is m=-15-13k+7-k, which is equivalent to m=-287, or m=-4. It's given that the y-intercept of the line is (k-5,b). Substituting -4 for m and the coordinates of the points (k-5,b) and (k,13) into the slope formula yields -4=13-bk-k-5, which is equivalent to -4=13-bk-k+5, or -4=13-b5. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 5 yields -20=13-b. Subtracting 13 from both sides of this equation yields -33=-b. Dividing both sides of this equation by -1 yields b=33.

It’s given in the table that the coordinates of two points on a line in the xy-plane are $\left(\right. k , 13 \left.\right)$ and $\left(\right. k + 7 , - 15 \left.\right)$. The y-intercept is another point on the line. The slope computed using any pair of points from the line will be the same. The slope of a line, $m$, between any two points, $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, on the line can be calculated using the slope formula, $m = \frac{\left(y_{2} - y_{1}\right)}{\left(x_{2} - x_{1}\right)}$. It follows that the slope of the line with the given points from the table, $\left(\right. k , 13 \left.\right)$ and $\left(\right. k + 7 , - 15 \left.\right)$, is $m = \frac{- 15 - 13}{k + 7 - k}$, which is equivalent to $m = \frac{- 28}{7}$, or $m = - 4$. It's given that the y-intercept of the line is $\left(\right. k - 5 , b \left.\right)$. Substituting $- 4$ for $m$ and the coordinates of the points $\left(\right. k - 5 , b \left.\right)$ and $\left(\right. k , 13 \left.\right)$ into the slope formula yields $- 4 = \frac{13 - b}{k - \left(k - 5\right)}$, which is equivalent to $- 4 = \frac{13 - b}{k - k + 5}$, or $- 4 = \frac{13 - b}{5}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $5$ yields $- 20 = 13 - b$. Subtracting $13$ from both sides of this equation yields $- 33 = - b$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $- 1$ yields $b = 33$. Therefore, the value of $b$ is $33$."

The equation of line h can be written in slope-intercept form y=mx+b, where m is the slope of the line and 0,b is the y-intercept of the line. It’s given that line h contains the points 18,130, 23,160, and 26,178. Therefore, its slope m can be found as 160-13023-18, or 6. Substituting 6 for m in the equation y=mx+b yields y=6x+b. Substituting 130 for y and 18 for x in this equation yields 130=6(18)+b, or 130=108+b. Subtracting 108 from both sides of this equation yields 22=b. Substituting 22 for b in y=6x+b yields y=6x+22. Since line k is the result of translating line h down 5 units, an equation of line k is y=6x+22-5, or y=6x+17. Substituting 0 for y in this equation yields 0=6x+17.

Therefore, its slope $m$ can be found as $\frac{160 - 130}{23 - 18}$, or $6$. Substituting $6$ for $m$ in the equation $y = m x + b$ yields $y = 6 x + b$. Substituting $130$ for $y$ and $18$ for $x$ in this equation yields $130 = 6 \left(\right. 18 \left.\right) + b$, or $130 = 108 + b$. Subtracting $108$ from both sides of this equation yields $22 = b$. Substituting $22$ for $b$ in $y = 6 x + b$ yields $y = 6 x + 22$. Since line $k$ is the result of translating line $h$ down $5$ units, an equation of line $k$ is $y = 6 x + 22 - 5$, or $y = 6 x + 17$. Substituting $0$ for $y$ in this equation yields $0 = 6 x + 17$.

Choice B is incorrect. This could define a linear function where its graph has a positive, not negative, y-intercept. Choice C is incorrect. This could define a linear function where its graph has a positive, not negative, slope. Choice D is incorrect. This could define a linear function where its graph has a positive, not negative, y-intercept and a positive, not negative, slope.","Choice A is correct. It’s given that the graph of the linear function $y = f \left(x\right) + 19$ is shown. This means that the graph of $y = f \left(x\right) + 19$ can be translated down $19$ units to create the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ and the y-coordinate of every point on the graph of $y = f \left(x\right) + 19$ can be decreased by $19$ to find the resulting point on the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$. The y-intercept of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right) + 19$ is $\left(0 , 3\right)$. Translating the graph of $y = f \left(x\right) + 19$ down $19$ units results in a y-intercept of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ at the point $\left(0 , 3 - 19\right)$, or $\left(0 , - 16\right)$. The graph of $y = f \left(x\right) + 19$ slants down from left to right, so the slope of the graph is negative. The translation of a linear graph changes its position, but does not change its slope. It follows that the slope of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ is also negative. The equation of a linear function $f$ can be written in the form $f \left(x\right) = b + m x$, where $b$ is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept and $m$ is the slope of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$. It's given that $c$ and $d$ are positive constants. Since the y-coordinate of the y-intercept and the slope of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ are both negative, it follows that $f \left(x\right) = - d - c x$ could define $f$. Choice B is incorrect. This could define a linear function where its graph has a positive, not negative, y-intercept. Choice C is incorrect. This could define a linear function where its graph has a positive, not negative, slope. Choice D is incorrect. This could define a linear function where its graph has a positive, not negative, y-intercept and a positive, not negative, slope."

It's given that there is a linear relationship between a plumber's hours of labor, h, and the plumber's total charge fh, in dollars. It follows that the relationship can be represented by an equation of the form fh=mh+b, where m is the rate of change of the function f and b is a constant. The rate of change of f can be calculated by dividing the difference in two values of fh by the difference in the corresponding values of h. Based on the values given in the table, the rate of change of f is 285-1553-1, or 65. Substituting 65 for m in the equation fh=mh+b yields fh=65h+b. The value of b can be found by substituting any value of h and its corresponding value of fh for h and fh, respectively, in this equation. Substituting 1 for h and 155 for fh yields 155=651+b, or 155=65+b. Subtracting 65 from both sides of this equation yields 90=b. Substituting 90 for b in the equation fh=65h+b yields f(h)=65h+90.

It's given that the table shows values of x and their corresponding values of gx, where gx=fxx+3. It's also given that f is a linear function. It follows that an equation that defines f can be written in the form fx=mx+b, where m represents the slope and b represents the y-coordinate of the y-intercept 0,b of the graph of y=fx in the xy-plane. The slope of the graph of y=fx can be found using two points, x1,y1 and x2,y2, that are on the graph of y=fx, and the formula m=y2-y1x2-x1. Since the table shows values of x and their corresponding values of gx, substituting values of x and gx in the equation gx=fxx+3 can be used to define function f. Using the first pair of values from the table, x=-27 and gx=3, yields 3=f-27-27+3, or 3=f-27-24. Multiplying each side of this equation by -24 yields -72=f-27, so the point -27,-72 is on the graph of y=fx. Using the second pair of values from the table, x=-9 and gx=0, yields 0=f-9-9+3, or 0=f-9-6. Multiplying each side of this equation by -6 yields 0=f-9, so the point -9,0 is on the graph of y=fx. Substituting -27,-72 and -9,0 for x1,y1 and x2,y2, respectively, in the formula m=y2-y1x2-x1 yields m=0--72-9--27, or m=4. Substituting 4 for m in the equation fx=mx+b yields fx=4x+b. Since 0=f-9, substituting -9 for x and 0 for fx in the equation fx=4x+b yields 0=4-9+b, or 0=-36+b. Adding 36 to both sides of this equation yields 36=b. It follows that 36 is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept 0,b of the graph of y=fx. Therefore, the y-intercept of the graph of y=fx is 0,36. Choice B is incorrect. 12 is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y=gx. Choice C is incorrect. 4 is the slope of the graph of y=fx.

It's given that the table shows values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $g \left(x\right)$, where $g \left(x\right) = \frac{f \left(x\right)}{x + 3}$. It's also given that $f$ is a linear function. It follows that an equation that defines $f$ can be written in the form $f \left(x\right) = m x + b$, where $m$ represents the slope and $b$ represents the y-coordinate of the y-intercept $\left(0 , b\right)$ of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane. The slope of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ can be found using two points, $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, that are on the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$, and the formula $m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$. Since the table shows values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $g \left(x\right)$, substituting values of $x$ and $g \left(x\right)$ in the equation $g \left(x\right) = \frac{f \left(x\right)}{x + 3}$ can be used to define function $f$. Using the first pair of values from the table, $x = - 27$ and $g \left(x\right) = 3$, yields $3 = \frac{f \left(- 27\right)}{- 27 + 3}$, or $3 = \frac{f \left(- 27\right)}{- 24}$. Multiplying each side of this equation by $- 24$ yields $- 72 = f \left(- 27\right)$, so the point $\left(- 27 , - 72\right)$ is on the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$. Using the second pair of values from the table, $x = - 9$ and $g \left(x\right) = 0$, yields $0 = \frac{f \left(- 9\right)}{- 9 + 3}$, or $0 = \frac{f \left(- 9\right)}{- 6}$. Multiplying each side of this equation by $- 6$ yields $0 = f \left(- 9\right)$, so the point $\left(- 9 , 0\right)$ is on the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$. Substituting $\left(- 27 , - 72\right)$ and $\left(- 9 , 0\right)$ for $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, respectively, in the formula $m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$ yields $m = \frac{0 - \left(- 72\right)}{- 9 - \left(- 27\right)}$, or $m = 4$. Substituting $4$ for $m$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = m x + b$ yields $f \left(x\right) = 4 x + b$. Since $0 = f \left(- 9\right)$, substituting $- 9$ for $x$ and $0$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = 4 x + b$ yields $0 = 4 \left(- 9\right) + b$, or $0 = - 36 + b$. Adding $36$ to both sides of this equation yields $36 = b$. It follows that $36$ is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept $\left(0 , b\right)$ of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$. Therefore, the y-intercept of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ is $\left(0 , 36\right)$. Choice B is incorrect. $12$ is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of $y = g \left(x\right)$.

The table shows an increasing exponential relationship between the number of years, $x$, since Hana started training in pole vault and the estimated height $h \left(x\right)$, in meters, of her best pole vault for that year. The relationship can be written as $h \left(x\right) = C a^{x}$, where $C$ and $a$ are positive constants. It's given that when $x = 0$, $h \left(x\right) = 1.23$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $1.23$ for $h \left(x\right)$ in $h \left(x\right) = C a^{x}$ yields $1.23 = C a^{0}$, or $1.23 = C$. Substituting $1.23$ for $C$ in $h \left(x\right) = C a^{x}$ yields $h \left(x\right) = 1.23 a^{x}$. It's also given that when $x = 2$, $h \left(x\right) = 1.54$. Substituting $2$ for $x$ and $1.54$ for $h \left(x\right)$ in $h \left(x\right) = 1.23 a^{x}$ yields $1.54 = 1.23 a^{2}$. Dividing each side of this equation by $1.23$ yields $\frac{1.54}{1.23} = \frac{1.23 a^{2}}{1.23}$, or $a^{2}$ is approximately equal to $1.252$. Since $a$ is positive, $a$ is approximately equal to $\sqrt{1.252}$, or $1.12$. Substituting $1.12$ for $a$ in $h \left(x\right) = 1.23 a^{x}$ yields $h \left(x\right) = 1.23 \left(1.12\right)^{x}$. Choice A is incorrect. When $x = 0$, the value of $h \left(x\right)$ in this function is equal to $1.12$ rather than $1.23$, and it is decreasing rather than increasing. Choice B is incorrect. When $x = 0$, the value of $h \left(x\right)$ in this function is equal to $1.12$ rather than $1.23$. Choice C is incorrect. This function is decreasing rather than increasing."

Since the graph passes through the point 0,-6, it follows that when the value of x is 0, the value of y is -6. Substituting 0 for x and -6 for y in the given equation yields -6=202+b0+c, or -6=c. Therefore, the value of c is -6. Substituting -6 for c in the given equation yields y=2x2+bx-6. Since the graph passes through the point -1,-8, it follows that when the value of x is -1, the value of y is -8. Substituting -1 for x and -8 for y in the equation y=2x2+bx-6 yields -8=2-12+b-1-6, or -8=2-b-6, which is equivalent to -8=-4-b. Adding 4 to each side of this equation yields -4=-b. Dividing each side of this equation by -1 yields 4=b. Since the value of b is 4 and the value of c is -6, it follows that the value of bc is 4-6, or -24. Alternate approach: The given equation represents a parabola in the xy-plane with a vertex at -1,-8. Therefore, the given equation, y=2x2+bx+c, which is written in standard form, can be written in vertex form, y=ax-h2+k, where h,k is the vertex of the parabola and a is the value of the coefficient on the x2 term when the equation is written in standard form. It follows that a=2. Substituting 2 for a, -1 for h, and -8 for k in this equation yields y=2x--12+-8, or y=2x+12-8. Squaring the binomial on the right-hand side of this equation yields y=2x2+2x+1-8. Multiplying each term inside the parentheses on the right-hand side of this equation by 2 yields y=2x2+4x+2-8, which is equivalent to y=2x2+4x-6. From the given equation y=2x2+bx+c, it follows that the value of b is 4 and the value of c is -6. Therefore, the value of bc is 4-6, or -24.","The correct answer is $- 24$. Since the graph passes through the point $\left(0 , - 6\right)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $0$, the value of $y$ is $- 6$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $- 6$ for $y$ in the given equation yields $- 6 = 2 \left(0\right)^{2} + b \left(0\right) + c$, or $- 6 = c$. Therefore, the value of $c$ is $- 6$. Substituting $- 6$ for $c$ in the given equation yields $y = 2 x^{2} + b x - 6$. Since the graph passes through the point $\left(- 1 , - 8\right)$, it follows that when the value of $x$ is $- 1$, the value of $y$ is $- 8$. Substituting $- 1$ for $x$ and $- 8$ for $y$ in the equation $y = 2 x^{2} + b x - 6$ yields $- 8 = 2 \left(- 1\right)^{2} + b \left(- 1\right) - 6$, or $- 8 = 2 - b - 6$, which is equivalent to $- 8 = - 4 - b$. Adding $4$ to each side of this equation yields $- 4 = - b$. Dividing each side of this equation by $- 1$ yields $4 = b$. Since the value of $b$ is $4$ and the value of $c$ is $- 6$, it follows that the value of $b c$ is $\left(4\right) \left(- 6\right)$, or $- 24$. Alternate approach: The given equation represents a parabola in the xy-plane with a vertex at $\left(- 1 , - 8\right)$. Therefore, the given equation, $y = 2 x^{2} + b x + c$, which is written in standard form, can be written in vertex form, $y = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$, where $\left(h , k\right)$ is the vertex of the parabola and $a$ is the value of the coefficient on the $x^{2}$ term when the equation is written in standard form. It follows that $a = 2$. Substituting $2$ for $a$, $- 1$ for $h$, and $- 8$ for $k$ in this equation yields $y = 2 \left(x - \left(- 1\right)\right)^{2} + \left(- 8\right)$, or $y = 2 \left(x + 1\right)^{2} - 8$. Squaring the binomial on the right-hand side of this equation yields $y = 2 \left(x^{2} + 2 x + 1\right) - 8$. Multiplying each term inside the parentheses on the right-hand side of this equation by $2$ yields $y = 2 x^{2} + 4 x + 2 - 8$, which is equivalent to $y = 2 x^{2} + 4 x - 6$. From the given equation $y = 2 x^{2} + b x + c$, it follows that the value of $b$ is $4$ and the value of $c$ is $- 6$. Therefore, the value of $b c$ is $\left(4\right) \left(- 6\right)$, or $- 24$."

The equation of a quadratic function can be written in the form fx=ax-h2+k, where a, h, and k are constants. It’s given in the table that when x=-1, the corresponding value of fx is 10. Substituting -1 for x and 10 for fx in the equation fx=ax-h2+k gives 10=a-1-h2+k, which is equivalent to 10=a1+2h+h2+k, or 10=a+2ah+ah2+k. It’s given in the table that when x=0, the corresponding value of fx is 14. Substituting 0 for x and 14 for fx in the equation fx=ax-h2+k gives 14=a0-h2+k, or 14=ah2+k. It’s given in the table that when x=1, the corresponding value of fx is 20. Substituting 1 for x and 20 for fx in the equation fx=ax-h2+k gives 20=a1-h2+k, which is equivalent to 20=a1-2h+h2+k, or 20=a-2ah+ah2+k. Adding 20=a-2ah+ah2+k to the equation 10=a+2ah+ah2+k gives 30=2a+2ah2+2k. Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 gives 15=a+ah2+k. Since 14=ah2+k, substituting 14 for ah2+k into the equation 15=a+ah2+k gives 15=a+14. Subtracting 14 from both sides of this equation gives a=1. Substituting 1 for a in the equations 14=ah2+k and 20=ah2-2ah+a+k gives 14=h2+k and 20=1-2h+h2+k, respectively. Since 14=h2+k, substituting 14 for h2+k in the equation 20=1-2h+h2+k gives 20=1-2h+14, or 20=15-2h. Subtracting 15 from both sides of this equation gives 5=-2h. Dividing both sides of this equation by -2 gives -52=h. Substituting -52 for h into the equation 14=h2+k gives 14=-522+k, or 14=254+k. Subtracting 254 from both sides of this equation gives 314=k. Substituting 1 for a, -52 for h, and 314 for k in the equation fx=ax-h2+k gives fx=x+522+314, which is equivalent to fx=x2+5x+254+314, or fx=x2+5x+14. Therefore, fx=x2+5x+14 defines f.

The equation of a quadratic function can be written in the form $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants. It’s given in the table that when $x = - 1$, the corresponding value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $10$. Substituting $- 1$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$ gives $10 = a \left(- 1 - h\right)^{2} + k$, which is equivalent to $10 = a \left(1 + 2 h + h^{2}\right) + k$, or $10 = a + 2 a h + a h^{2} + k$. It’s given in the table that when $x = 0$, the corresponding value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $14$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $14$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$ gives $14 = a \left(0 - h\right)^{2} + k$, or $14 = a h^{2} + k$. It’s given in the table that when $x = 1$, the corresponding value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $20$. Substituting $1$ for $x$ and $20$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$ gives $20 = a \left(1 - h\right)^{2} + k$, which is equivalent to $20 = a \left(1 - 2 h + h^{2}\right) + k$, or $20 = a - 2 a h + a h^{2} + k$. Adding $20 = a - 2 a h + a h^{2} + k$ to the equation $10 = a + 2 a h + a h^{2} + k$ gives $30 = 2 a + 2 a h^{2} + 2 k$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ gives $15 = a + a h^{2} + k$. Since $14 = a h^{2} + k$, substituting $14$ for $a h^{2} + k$ into the equation $15 = a + a h^{2} + k$ gives $15 = a + 14$. Subtracting $14$ from both sides of this equation gives $a = 1$. Substituting $1$ for $a$ in the equations $14 = a h^{2} + k$ and $20 = a h^{2} - 2 a h + a + k$ gives $14 = h^{2} + k$ and $20 = 1 - 2 h + h^{2} + k$, respectively. Since $14 = h^{2} + k$, substituting $14$ for $h^{2} + k$ in the equation $20 = 1 - 2 h + h^{2} + k$ gives $20 = 1 - 2 h + 14$, or $20 = 15 - 2 h$. Subtracting $15$ from both sides of this equation gives $5 = - 2 h$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $- 2$ gives $- \frac{5}{2} = h$. Substituting $- \frac{5}{2}$ for $h$ into the equation $14 = h^{2} + k$ gives $14 = \left(- \frac{5}{2}\right)^{2} + k$, or $14 = \frac{25}{4} + k$. Subtracting $\frac{25}{4}$ from both sides of this equation gives $\frac{31}{4} = k$. Substituting $1$ for $a$, $- \frac{5}{2}$ for $h$, and $\frac{31}{4}$ for $k$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$ gives $f \left(x\right) = \left(x + \frac{5}{2}\right)^{2} + \frac{31}{4}$, which is equivalent to $f \left(x\right) = x^{2} + 5 x + \frac{25}{4} + \frac{31}{4}$, or $f \left(x\right) = x^{2} + 5 x + 14$. Therefore, $f \left(x\right) = x^{2} + 5 x + 14$ defines $f$. Choice A is incorrect. If $f \left(x\right) = 3 x^{2} + 3 x + 14$, then when $x = - 1$, the corresponding value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $14$, not $10$. Choice B is incorrect. If $f \left(x\right) = 5 x^{2} + x + 14$, then when $x = - 1$, the corresponding value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $18$, not $10$. Choice C is incorrect. If $f \left(x\right) = 9 x^{2} - x + 14$, then when $x = - 1$, the corresponding value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $24$, not $10$, and when $x = 1$, the corresponding value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $22$, not $20$."

It’s given that the relationship between t and d is exponential. The table shows that the value of d increases as the value of t increases. Therefore, the relationship between t and d can be represented by an increasing exponential equation of the form d=a1+bt, where a and b are positive constants. The table shows that when t=0, d=670. Substituting 0 for t and 670 for d in the equation d=a1+bt yields 670=a1+b0, which is equivalent to 670=a1, or 670=a. Substituting 670 for a in the equation d=a1+bt yields d=6701+bt. The table also shows that when t=1, d=674.02. Substituting 1 for t and 674.02 for d in the equation d=6701+bt yields 674.02=6701+b1, or 674.02=6701+b. Dividing both sides of this equation by 670 yields 1.006=1+b. Subtracting 1 from both sides of this equation yields b=0.006. Substituting 0.006 for b in the equation d=6701+bt yields d=6701+0.006t.

It’s given that the relationship between $t$ and $d$ is exponential. The table shows that the value of $d$ increases as the value of $t$ increases. Therefore, the relationship between $t$ and $d$ can be represented by an increasing exponential equation of the form $d = a \left(1 + b\right)^{t}$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive constants. The table shows that when $t = 0$, $d = 670$. Substituting $0$ for $t$ and $670$ for $d$ in the equation $d = a \left(1 + b\right)^{t}$ yields $670 = a \left(1 + b\right)^{0}$, which is equivalent to $670 = a \left(1\right)$, or $670 = a$. Substituting $670$ for $a$ in the equation $d = a \left(1 + b\right)^{t}$ yields $d = 670 \left(1 + b\right)^{t}$. The table also shows that when $t = 1$, $d = 674.02$. Substituting $1$ for $t$ and $674.02$ for $d$ in the equation $d = 670 \left(1 + b\right)^{t}$ yields $674.02 = 670 \left(1 + b\right)^{1}$, or $674.02 = 670 \left(1 + b\right)$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $670$ yields $1.006 = 1 + b$. Subtracting $1$ from both sides of this equation yields $b = 0.006$.

It's given that f is a quadratic function. It follows that f can be defined by an equation of the form fx=ax-h2+k, where a, h, and k are constants. It's also given that the table shows three values of x and their corresponding values of y, where y=fx+4. Substituting ax-h2+k for fx in this equation yields y=ax-h2+k+4. This equation represents a quadratic relationship between x and y, where k+4 is either the maximum or the minimum value of y, which occurs when x=h. For quadratic relationships between x and y, the maximum or minimum value of y occurs at the value of x halfway between any two values of x that have the same corresponding value of y. The table shows that x-values of 21 and 25 correspond to the same y-value, -8. Since 23 is halfway between 21 and 25, the maximum or minimum value of y occurs at an x-value of 23. The table shows that when x=23, y=8. It follows that h=23 and k+4=8. Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation k+4=8 yields k=4. Substituting 23 for h and 4 for k in the equation y=ax-h2+k+4 yields y=ax-232+4+4, or y=ax-232+8. The value of a can be found by substituting any x-value and its corresponding y-value for x and y, respectively, in this equation. Substituting 25 for x and -8 for y in this equation yields -8=a25-232+8, or -8=a22+8. Subtracting 8 from both sides of this equation yields -16=a22, or -16=4a. Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields -4=a. Substituting -4 for a, 23 for h, and 4 for k in the equation fx=ax-h2+k yields fx=-4x-232+4. The y-intercept of the graph of y=fx in the xy-plane is the point on the graph where x=0. Substituting 0 for x in the equation fx=-4x-232+4 yields f0=-40-232+4, or f0=-4-232+4. This is equivalent to f0=-2,112, so the y-intercept of the graph of y=fx in the xy-plane is 0,-2,112. Thus, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y=fx in the xy-plane is -2,112.","The correct answer is $- 2,112$. It's given that $f$ is a quadratic function. It follows that $f$ can be defined by an equation of the form $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants. It's also given that the table shows three values of $x$ and their corresponding values of $y$, where $y = f \left(x\right) + 4$. Substituting $a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in this equation yields $y = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k + 4$. This equation represents a quadratic relationship between $x$ and $y$, where $k + 4$ is either the maximum or the minimum value of $y$, which occurs when $x = h$. For quadratic relationships between $x$ and $y$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at the value of $x$ halfway between any two values of $x$ that have the same corresponding value of $y$. The table shows that x-values of $21$ and $25$ correspond to the same y-value, $- 8$. Since $23$ is halfway between $21$ and $25$, the maximum or minimum value of $y$ occurs at an x-value of $23$. The table shows that when $x = 23$, $y = 8$. It follows that $h = 23$ and $k + 4 = 8$. Subtracting $4$ from both sides of the equation $k + 4 = 8$ yields $k = 4$. Substituting $23$ for $h$ and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $y = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k + 4$ yields $y = a \left(x - 23\right)^{2} + 4 + 4$, or $y = a \left(x - 23\right)^{2} + 8$. The value of $a$ can be found by substituting any x-value and its corresponding y-value for $x$ and $y$, respectively, in this equation. Substituting $25$ for $x$ and $- 8$ for $y$ in this equation yields $- 8 = a \left(25 - 23\right)^{2} + 8$, or $- 8 = a \left(2\right)^{2} + 8$. Subtracting $8$ from both sides of this equation yields $- 16 = a \left(2\right)^{2}$, or $- 16 = 4 a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $- 4 = a$. Substituting $- 4$ for $a$, $23$ for $h$, and $4$ for $k$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$ yields $f \left(x\right) = - 4 \left(x - 23\right)^{2} + 4$. The y-intercept of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane is the point on the graph where $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = - 4 \left(x - 23\right)^{2} + 4$ yields $f \left(0\right) = - 4 \left(0 - 23\right)^{2} + 4$, or $f \left(0\right) = - 4 \left(- 23\right)^{2} + 4$. This is equivalent to $f \left(0\right) = - 2,112$, so the y-intercept of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane is $\left(0 , - 2,112\right)$.

It's given that the scatterplot shows the relationship between the length of time y, in hours, a certain bird spent in flight and the number of days after January 11, x. Since January 13 is 2 days after January 11, it follows that January 13 corresponds to an x-value of 2 in the scatterplot. In the scatterplot, when x=2, the corresponding value of y is 6. In other words, on January 13, the bird spent 6 hours in flight. Since January 15 is 4 days after January 11, it follows that January 15 corresponds to an x-value of 4 in the scatterplot.

A linear model can be written in the form y=mx+b, where m is the slope of the graph of the model in the xy-plane and (0,b) is the y-intercept. The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points (1,3) and (9,10) in the xy-plane. Two points on a line, x1,y1 and x2,y2, can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, m=y2-y1x2-x1. Substituting the points (1,3) and (9,10) for x1,y1 and x2,y2, respectively, in the slope formula yields m=10-39-1, or m=0.875. Therefore, the value of m for an appropriate linear model is approximately 0.875. Substituting 0.875 for m in y=mx+b yields y=0.875x+b. Since an appropriate linear model passes near the point (1,3), the approximate value of b can be found by substituting 1 for x and 3 for y in the equation y=0.875x+b, which yields 3=(0.875)(1)+b, or 3=0.875+b. Subtracting 0.875 from both sides of this equation yields 2.125=b. Therefore, the value of b for an appropriate linear model is approximately 2.125.

The graph of an appropriate linear model for this relationship passes near the points $\left(\right. 1 , 3 \left.\right)$ and $\left(\right. 9 , 10 \left.\right)$ in the xy-plane. Two points on a line, $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, can be used to find the slope of the line using the slope formula, $m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$. Substituting the points $\left(\right. 1 , 3 \left.\right)$ and $\left(\right. 9 , 10 \left.\right)$ for $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, respectively, in the slope formula yields $m = \frac{10 - 3}{9 - 1}$, or $m = 0.875$. Therefore, the value of $m$ for an appropriate linear model is approximately $0.875$. Substituting $0.875$ for $m$ in $y = m x + b$ yields $y = 0.875 x + b$. Since an appropriate linear model passes near the point $\left(\right. 1 , 3 \left.\right)$, the approximate value of $b$ can be found by substituting $1$ for $x$ and $3$ for $y$ in the equation $y = 0.875 x + b$, which yields $3 = \left(\right. 0.875 \left.\right) \left(\right. 1 \left.\right) + b$, or $3 = 0.875 + b$. Subtracting $0.875$ from both sides of this equation yields $2.125 = b$. Therefore, the value of $b$ for an appropriate linear model is approximately $2.125$.

Since points $S$, $Q$, and $X$ form a triangle, it follows from the triangle angle sum theorem that the measure, in degrees, of $\angle Q S X$ is $180 - 48 - 86$, or $46$. It's also given that the measure of $\angle S W U$ is $85 \circ$. Since $\angle S W U$ and $\angle S W R$ are supplementary angles, the sum of their measures is $180$ degrees. It follows that the measure, in degrees, of $\angle S W R$ is $180 - 85$, or $95$. Since points $R$, $S$, and $W$ form a triangle, and $\angle R S W$ is the same angle as $\angle Q S X$, it follows from the triangle angle sum theorem that the measure, in degrees, of $\angle W R S$ is $180 - 46 - 95$, or $39$. It's given that the measure of $\angle V T U$ is $162 \circ$. Since $\angle V T U$ and $\angle S T U$ are supplementary angles, the sum of their measures is $180$ degrees. It follows that the measure, in degrees, of $\angle S T U$ is $180 - 162$, or $18$. Since points $R$, $T$, and $U$ form a triangle, and $\angle U R T$ is the same angle as $\angle W R S$, it follows from the triangle angle sum theorem that the measure, in degrees, of $\angle T U R$ is $180 - 39 - 18$, or $123$."

Therefore, the sum of the measures of these two angles is 180°. It's given that b=122.

Therefore, the interior angle of the triangle has measure $43 \circ$. A second interior angle of the triangle forms a straight line, $q$, with the angle marked $b \circ$.

Substituting -6,4 and 3,10 for x1,y1 and x2,y2, respectively, in the distance formula yields 3--62+10-42, or 92+62, which is equivalent to 81+36, or 117.

The segment shown has endpoints at $\left(- 6 , 4\right)$ and $\left(3 , 10\right)$. Substituting $\left(- 6 , 4\right)$ and $\left(3 , 10\right)$ for $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, respectively, in the distance formula yields $\sqrt{\left(3 - \left(- 6\right)\right)^{2} + \left(10 - 4\right)^{2}}$, or $\sqrt{9^{2} + 6^{2}}$, which is equivalent to $\sqrt{81 + 36}$, or $\sqrt{117}$.

What is the area, in square units, of triangle $A D E$?",Right triangle upper A upper D upper E. Refer to long description.,,,,,,,,,480,480,"The correct answer is 480. It's given in the figure that angle ACB and angle AED are right angles. It follows that angle ACB is congruent to angle AED. It's also given that angle BAC and angle DAE are the same angle. It follows that angle BAC is congruent to angle DAE. Since triangles ABC and ADE have two pairs of congruent angles, the triangles are similar. Sides AB and AC in triangle ABC correspond to sides AD and AE, respectively, in triangle ADE. Corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional. Therefore, ADAB=AEAC. It's given that AC=3 units and CE=21 units. Therefore, AE=24 units. It’s also given that AB=34 units. Substituting 3 for AC, 24 for AE, and 34 for AB in the equation ADAB=AEAC yields AD34=243, or AD34=8. Multiplying each side of this equation by 34 yields AD=834. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length c and legs with lengths a and b, then a2+b2=c2. Since triangle ADE is a right triangle, it follows that AD represents the length of the hypotenuse, c, and DE and AE represent the lengths of the legs, a and b. Substituting 24 for b and 834 for c in the equation a2+b2=c2 yields a2+242=8342, which is equivalent to a2+576=6434, or a2+576=2,176. Subtracting 576 from both sides of this equation yields a2=1,600. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields a=±40. Since a represents a length, which must be positive, the value of a is 40. Therefore, DE=40. Since DE and AE represent the lengths of the legs of triangle ADE, it follows that DE and AE can be used to calculate the area, in square units, of the triangle as 124024, or 480. Therefore, the area, in square units, of triangle ADE is 480.","The correct answer is $480$. It's given in the figure that angle $A C B$ and angle $A E D$ are right angles. It follows that angle $A C B$ is congruent to angle $A E D$. It's also given that angle $B A C$ and angle $D A E$ are the same angle. It follows that angle $B A C$ is congruent to angle $D A E$. Since triangles $A B C$ and $A D E$ have two pairs of congruent angles, the triangles are similar. Sides $A B$ and $A C$ in triangle $A B C$ correspond to sides $A D$ and $A E$, respectively, in triangle $A D E$. Corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional. Therefore, $\frac{A D}{A B} = \frac{A E}{A C}$. It's given that $A C = 3$ units and $C E = 21$ units. Therefore, $A E = 24$ units. It’s also given that $A B = \sqrt{34}$ units. Substituting $3$ for $A C$, $24$ for $A E$, and $\sqrt{34}$ for $A B$ in the equation $\frac{A D}{A B} = \frac{A E}{A C}$ yields $\frac{A D}{\sqrt{34}} = \frac{24}{3}$, or $\frac{A D}{\sqrt{34}} = 8$. Multiplying each side of this equation by $\sqrt{34}$ yields $A D = 8 \sqrt{34}$. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$. Since triangle $A D E$ is a right triangle, it follows that $A D$ represents the length of the hypotenuse, $c$, and $D E$ and $A E$ represent the lengths of the legs, $a$ and $b$. Substituting $24$ for $b$ and $8 \sqrt{34}$ for $c$ in the equation $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$ yields $a^{2} + \left(24\right)^{2} = \left(8 \sqrt{34}\right)^{2}$, which is equivalent to $a^{2} + 576 = 64 \left(34\right)$, or $a^{2} + 576 = 2,176$. Subtracting $576$ from both sides of this equation yields $a^{2} = 1,600$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $a = \pm 40$. Since $a$ represents a length, which must be positive, the value of $a$ is $40$. Therefore, $D E = 40$. Since $D E$ and $A E$ represent the lengths of the legs of triangle $A D E$, it follows that $D E$ and $A E$ can be used to calculate the area, in square units, of the triangle as $\frac{1}{2} \left(40\right) \left(24\right)$, or $480$. Therefore, the area, in square units, of triangle $A D E$ is $480$."

The graph shows characteristics of the banks of the Provo River downstream of the Jordanelle Dam in three different years—1987, 1993, and 2006. Specifically, the graph shows the amount of grass cover, bare soil, and forest cover in those years. The text indicates that the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992, meaning that the data from the graph for 1987 reflect conditions before the dam was built, whereas the data for 1993 and 2006 reflect conditions after the dam was built. The data show that grass cover increased substantially from 1987 to 1993 and again from 1993 to 2006. The data also show that forest cover declined over those periods. Together, these data support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam was beneficial for grass plants but not for trees—grass cover increased significantly after the dam was built, while forest cover declined. Choice A is incorrect. Although it is true that, in the graph, the lowest value for grass cover is approximately 58,000 square meters and the highest value for forest cover is approximately 75,000 square meters, both values are from 1987, before the Jordanelle Dam was built in 1992. Therefore, this information alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion about changes in grass and tree cover following the construction of the dam. Choice B is incorrect because it presents an inaccurate description of data from the graph. The graph shows that there was more forest cover than grass cover in 1987, not that there was more grass cover than forest cover that year. Choice C is incorrect because, while it accurately reflects data from the graph when it compares grass cover and forest cover to bare soil, these data alone cannot support Martinez and colleagues’ conclusion that the dam led to changes that benefited grass plants but not trees. An increase in grass cover relative to bare soil following the construction of the dam might indicate that the dam benefited grass plants, but the fact that there was more forest cover than bare soil in all three years doesn’t indicate that the dam failed to benefit trees.",

The graph presents values for the percentage of Ondo State small-scale farmers who are female, by type of crop and region. The graph shows that of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables, approximately 57% in north Ondo and approximately 54% in south Ondo are female; in other words, most of those farmers are female, which exemplifies the idea that female farmers make up the majority (more than half) of the farmers cultivating specific types of crops in some regions. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately cites data from the graph: the graph shows that in south Ondo, most of the farmers mainly cultivating non-root vegetables are women (approximately 54%), but that only about 35% (less than half) of the farmers mainly cultivating cereals are women.

The average number of department leaders directly reporting to their CEO during the 1991–1995 period was slightly more than three, during the 1996–2001 period it was four, and during the 2001–2008 period it was almost seven. Thus, the average number of department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose over the three periods studied, which suggests that CEOs were connecting with more departments. Choice A is incorrect because the average number of managers and department leaders reporting directly to their CEO rose for both categories between the 1991–1995 and 2001–2008 periods; thus, it isn’t true that the average numbers didn’t fluctuate.

Because efficient national government is necessary to provide urban services and infrastructure that attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. propose that absent other factors, the importance of GDP per capita growth to ULE would likely increase relative to the importance of population growth as governments become more efficient.

According to the text, ULE is influenced by urban population growth and by gross domestic product (GDP) growth per capita. Reasoning that efficient national governments provide urban services and infrastructure needed to attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as governments become more efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure, GDP growth per capita will account for more ULE and urban population growth will account for less. But according to the graph, Region 1 saw an increase in the percentage attributed to urban population growth from 1970–2000 (between 60 and 65%) to 2000–2014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decrease in the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970–2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000–2014 (about 25%). Because the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita decreased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the governments had become more efficient), the data suggest that the governments of Region 1 became less efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure over that period.Choice B is incorrect. Neither the graph nor the text gives the regions’ relative levels of economic growth or what effect Mahtta et al. would expect such growth to have. Furthermore, Mahtta et al.’s proposal suggests that Region 1’s decline in the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970–2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000–2014 (about 25%) would suggest decreasing, not increasing, government efficiency over this time. Choice C is incorrect. Neither the text nor the graph provides information about the relative efficiencies of different governments in Region 2. Choice D is incorrect. Mahtta et al.’s proposal suggests that more efficient governments will have a higher percentage of their ULE driven by GDP growth per capita and a lower percentage driven by urban population growth. For Region 2, the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita increased from 1970–2000 (between 10 and 15%) to 2000–2014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita decline over the same period.

Reading and Writing,Information and Ideas,Command of Evidence,Hard,"A student is researching the Chinese government’s 1992 shift to a market economy that emphasizes trade liberalization. One means of trade liberalization involves expanding from ordinary imports into an emphasis on processing imports, which have two types: processing with assembly (in which a firm obtains raw materials from a foreign trading partner without payment and sells the final goods to that partner, charging for assembly) and processing with inputs (in which a firm expends capital to buy raw materials from a trading partner, processes them into final goods, and sells those goods to whichever trading partner it chooses). The student asserts that while initial efforts at trade liberalization were shaped by Chinese firms’ limited capital, this situation resolved during the 2000s.

The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn’t require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China’s imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn’t, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms’ assets—and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports—were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.Choice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year.

The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student’s claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is “entirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,” meaning that the spider population wouldn’t have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population. Choice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Choice C is incorrect because the fact that the spider population in the enclosure with lizards fell more between days 1 and 10 than in other periods has nothing to do with the student’s claim that the reduction in spiders in that enclosure by day 30 can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Choice D is incorrect. Although it’s true that on day 30 the spider population was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards, this fact doesn’t weaken the student’s claim that the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Indeed, the lower spider population in the enclosure with lizards suggests that the lizards are contributing to the reduction in the spider population, though the fact that the spider population also fell substantially in the other enclosure means that the lizards aren’t the only cause of the reduction.",

The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have significantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure. This is evidence supporting the hypothesis that kanamycin exposure results in plants altering their uptake of metals. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that control plants contained higher levels of iron than zinc, not higher levels of zinc than iron; similarly, the plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of zinc than iron, not higher levels of iron than zinc. Choice B is incorrect. Though the claim that both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc is supported by the graph, this alone does not state whether plants with kanamycin exposure have a different metal content than plants without kanamycin exposure. Choice C is incorrect. The graph shows that the zinc levels for the control plants (those without kanamycin exposure) were around 400 parts per million, not 300 parts per million, and that the zinc levels for plants with kanamycin exposure were around 300 parts per million, not 400 parts per million.",

This increase illustrates the statement in the text that demand for Singer sewing machines grew significantly in the early twentieth century in overseas countries other than Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Choice B is incorrect because consistent sales of Singer sewing machines in New Zealand from 1903 to 1918 do not indicate that demand for the product increased but rather that demand remained relatively the same.

Reading and Writing,Information and Ideas,Command of Evidence,Hard,"Honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal (six-sided) units called cells, in which queens lay eggs. Hexagonal cells for eggs that develop into nonreproductive workers are smaller than those for eggs that develop into reproductive drones, though the size difference varies by species. Difference in cell size results in a construction problem—it’s hard to neatly connect sections of small cells to sections of large cells—that worsens as the difference increases. To fill in gaps between the sections when building a hive, bees rely on cells that have more or fewer than six sides. A student studying beehive structure consults data on three species, concluding that ______

The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species.Choice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn’t deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on ""many more"" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.",

The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in L. pertusa coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph’s horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of L. pertusa. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of L. pertusa declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the L. pertusa population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the L. pertusa decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral’s decline near the Mauritanian coast.Choice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in L. pertusa (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral’s population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral’s decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in L. pertusa than after—because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after—the graph doesn’t support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral’s decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of L. pertusa. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn’t effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of L. pertusa in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast.",

One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient at converting input power to output power. André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL.

The text explains that perovskite solar cells’ efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor’s team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor’s team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion about spray coating’s potential value. Choice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn’t support or relate to Taylor and colleagues’ conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph.

Reading and Writing,Information and Ideas,Command of Evidence,Medium,"Economists Kerwin Kofi Charles and Melvin Stephens Jr. investigated a variety of factors that influence voter turnout in the United States. Using survey data that revealed whether respondents voted in national elections and how knowledgeable respondents are about politics, Charles and Stephens claim that the likelihood of voting is driven in part by potential voters’ confidence in their assessments of candidates—essentially, the more informed voters are about politics, the more confident they are at evaluating whether candidates share their views, and thus the more likely they are to vote.

Thus, this statement accurately cites data from the graph that support Charles and Stephens’s claim about how level of information affects voters. Choice B is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the only probability in the graph below 50% is for low-information voters categorized as independent (orientation 4), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice C is incorrect. Although this statement is correct that the highest probabilities of voting for low-information voters are at the ends of the orientation scale (1 and 7), the claim in question is about the relative likelihood that low- and high-information voters will vote, and without some reference to high-information voters, this statement cannot help support such a comparison. Choice D is incorrect because the graph does not give any information about how many people are represented in any of the categories, so this statement is not based on data from the graph.

A survey recorded participants’ ratings of the candidates’ likability and showed that across participants, ignoble-trait candidates were less likable than admirable-trait candidates. However, when the researchers factored in the participants’ own personality-trait scores, on a scale of 1 (least ignoble) to 7 (most ignoble), they concluded that this relative ranking of candidates persisted except among the participants with high ignobility scores.

The values on the x-axis represent survey participants grouped by their own ignobility scores, from low ignobility (1) to high ignobility (7), while the values on the y-axis represent the likability scores given to the political candidates. The graph shows that the full range of participants (from least to most ignoble) gave the admirable-trait candidates (represented by the line with triangles) a likability rating of approximately 70 out of 100; that is, regardless of their own level of ignobility, participants generally found admirable-trait candidates quite likable. However, the graph shows that participants varied in their views of ignoble-trait candidates (represented by the line with squares); likability ratings increased as the participants’ own ignobility scores increased. Participants with low to medium-high ignobility scores (1 to 5) still rated the ignoble-trait candidates as less likable than the admirable-trait candidates, with all ratings falling below approximately 70, but participants with high ignobility scores (6 and 7) gave ratings equal to or higher than approximately 70. In other words, the previously observed trend of ranking admirable-trait candidates as more likable than ignoble-trait candidates persisted for participants with low to medium-high ignobility but not for participants with high ignobility.Choice A is incorrect because it describes the opposite of what the graph shows. The graph shows a positive correlation between participants’ ignobility scores and ignoble-trait candidates’ likability ratings (as participants’ ignobility scores increased, so did their ratings for ignoble-trait candidates’ likability) and no correlation between ignobility scores and admirable-trait candidates’ likability ratings (all participants gave admirable-trait candidates a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). Choice C is incorrect. The graph does show that regardless of their own ignobility scores, participants rated admirable-trait candidates as quite likable (a rating of approximately 70 out of 100). However, this doesn’t support the researchers’ conclusion because the conclusion has to do with how participants rated both types of candidates, not just the admirable-trait ones; moreover, the conclusion is that relative ratings were actually affected by the participants’ ignobility scores. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does show that only participants with an ignobility score of 6 gave the same likability score to both admirable- and ignoble-trait candidates while participants with other ignobility scores gave a different rating for each candidate, but this doesn’t support the researchers’ conclusion.

Participants in a control group were asked to reflect on their daily routine. All the participants then described how they would respond to a workplace scenario.

Both the control group and managers who reflected on a mistake they didn’t learn from received a lower average humility score of between 2.5 and 3.0. Thus, the managers who reflected on a past mistake that resulted in learning exhibited more humility on average than the managers in the other two groups did. This supports the researchers’ conclusion that their initial hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility was correct.Choice A is incorrect. Although according to the graph it’s true that none of the group’s humility scores exceeded 3.5, this idea does not support the researchers’ conclusion that their initial hypothesis was correct. The statement that none of the three groups’ average humility scores exceeded 3.5 does not distinguish between those leaders who reflected on lessons learned from past mistakes and those who didn’t, so it would not support Hu and colleagues’ hypothesis that workplace leaders who reflect on past mistakes they learned from exercise greater humility. Choice B is incorrect. While the graph shows that managers in the control group did exhibit less humility than the experimental group of managers who reflected on a mistake they learned from, the graph also shows that the control group exhibited more (not less) humility than the experimental group that reflected on a mistake they didn’t learn from.

According to the text, the researchers’ study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2–4 days of leave, and a group who took 1–5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2–4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1–5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2–4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1–5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues’ conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.Choice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1–5 weeks of leave. But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers’ conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2–4 days of leave with those who took 1–5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1–5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers’ conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2–4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers’ conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave. These results are therefore irrelevant to the conclusion.",
Reading and Writing,Information and Ideas,Command of Evidence,Hard,"Inés Ibáñez and colleagues studied a forest site in which some sugar maple trees receive periodic fertilization with nitrogen to mimic the broader trend of increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition in soil. Ibáñez and colleagues modeled the radial growth of the trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate scenarios (the current climate, moderate change, and extreme change). Although they found that climate change would negatively affect growth, they concluded that anthropogenic nitrogen deposition could more than offset that effect provided that change is moderate rather than extreme.

Which choice best describes data from the graph that support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion?",,"Bar graph titled Modeled Radial Growth of Sugar Maple Trees.

The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change. Thus, the data in the graph support the researchers’ conclusion by showing greater growth for a moderate change using nitrogen fertilization than they do either under current conditions without nitrogen fertilization or under an extreme change with nitrogen fertilization.Choice A is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn’t support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of anthropogenic nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it’s extreme. To support this would require comparing radial growth without nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under both moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth with nitrogen fertilization under current climate conditions and moderate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under an extreme change, which don’t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change. Choice B is incorrect. Although it accurately represents the data in the graph, this fact pattern doesn’t support Ibáñez and colleagues’ conclusion that the decline in radial growth due to climate change will be partly offset by higher levels of atmospheric nitrogen, but only if change to the climate is moderate and not if it’s extreme. The support needed would compare radial growth under current climate conditions without nitrogen fertilization to the growth with nitrogen fertilization under moderate and extreme changes. This choice mentions only growth without nitrogen fertilization under current conditions and moderate change and growth with nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don’t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change.

This choice mentions only the growth with and without nitrogen fertilization under moderate climate change and growth without nitrogen fertilization under extreme change, which don’t provide a basis to determine whether higher nitrogen in the future will be able to offset reduced growth due to climate change.",

Reading and Writing,Information and Ideas,Command of Evidence,Hard,"In a study of the evolution of DptA and DptB—Diptericin genes encoding antimicrobial peptides that combat pathogens and foster beneficial microbes in fruit flies (Drosophila)—researchers assessed Drosophila melanogaster resistance to pathogenic infections by Providencia rettgeri and Acetobacter sicerae, bacteria common in the flies’ environments. Subjects included flies identified by mutations silencing DptA, DptB, or both DptA and DptB (termed types A, B, and AB, respectively). In conjunction with the observation that resistance to P. rettgeri correlates with DptA activity but is not significantly affected by DptB activity, data in the graph of survival rates post–A. sicerae infection suggest that ______

The text indicates that in the fly D. melanogaster, DptA and DptB are genes that encode peptides that both fight pathogens and promote beneficial microbes. Researchers tested D. melanogaster’s resistance to P. rettgeri and A. sicerae bacteria based on which variation of the peptide-encoding gene the flies exhibit: DptA silenced (referred to as type A), DptB silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB). The text also indicates that resistance to P. rettgeri correlates with DptA activity but not with DptB activity (which would manifest as type B flies surviving at a higher rate than other fly types when exposed to P. rettgeri). The graph shows the post–A. sicerae infection results, which indicate that DptB activity was most strongly associated with survival, whereas DptA activity was not (manifesting in the graph as the type A flies having greater survival rates than the other fly types). In other words, when DptA activity was silenced, the flies showed relatively high survival rates, but when DptB activity was silenced, whether on its own or in conjunction with DptA activity being silenced, survival rates were low, suggesting that DptB may have developed as a specific defense against A. sicerae.Choice A is incorrect. The graph suggests that DptA activity is associated with a low rate of survival, not a high one. Furthermore, the graph shows results for flies where DptA alone was silenced, DptB alone was silenced, and both were silenced and thus does not show any flies with activity in both DptA and DptB, which would be necessary to determine whether DptA conferred defense against A. sicerae in the presence of DptB. Choice B is incorrect. Only two bacteria species were considered in the text: P. rettgeri and A. sicerae. The text and graph taken together suggest that activity in DptA is associated with resistance to P. rettgeri while DptB activity is not, and that DptB activity is associated with resistance to A. sicerae while DptA is not. There is no further information to suggest one genetic type confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens than the other. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does not address flies with activity in both DptA and DptB. All flies represented in the graph had one or both of DptA and DptB silenced, or inactive.",
