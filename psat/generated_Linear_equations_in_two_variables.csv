This is a true statement, confirming the equation is correct.",
Math,Algebra,Linear equations in two variables,Easy,"The height of a burning candle, $h$, in inches, is given by the equation $h = 12 - 0.5t$, where $t$ is the time in hours. After how many hours will the candle's height be 9 inches?",3,6,18,42,B,,The given equation is $h = 12 - 0.5t$.,"We want to find the number of hours, $t$, when the height, $h$, is 9 inches.",Substitute $h=9$ into the equation: $9 = 12 - 0.5t$.,"To solve for $t$, first subtract 12 from both sides: $9 - 12 = -0.5t$, which gives $-3 = -0.5t$.","Now, divide both sides by $-0.5$. Dividing by $-0.5$ is the same as multiplying by $-2$.",$t = \frac{-3}{-0.5} = 6$. It will take 6 hours.
Math,Algebra,Linear equations in two variables,Easy,Line $k$ has the equation $y = 8x-1$. Line $j$ is parallel to line $k$. What is the slope of line $j$?,$-8$,$-\frac{1}{8}$,$\frac{1}{8}$,$8$,D,,"The equation for line $k$ is given in slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope.","By comparing the given equation $y = 8x - 1$ to the slope-intercept form, we can identify the slope of line $k$ as $8$.",Parallel lines in the xy-plane have the same slope.,"Since line $j$ is parallel to line $k$, the slope of line $j$ must be equal to the slope of line $k$.","Therefore, the slope of line $j$ is $8$.",
Math,Algebra,Linear equations in two variables,Easy,"A coffee shop sells small cups of coffee for $2 and large cups for $4. In one hour, they sold a total of $60 worth of coffee. If $s$ is the number of small cups and $l$ is the number of large cups sold, which equation represents this situation?",$s + l = 60$,$6(s+l) = 60$,$4s + 2l = 60$,$2s + 4l = 60$,D,,Let $s$ be the number of small cups sold and $l$ be the number of large cups sold.,"The total revenue from small cups is the price per cup ($2) times the number of cups sold ($s$), which is $2s$.","The total revenue from large cups is the price per cup ($4) times the number of cups sold ($l$), which is $4l$.","The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from small and large cups, which is given as $60.","Therefore, the equation that models this relationship is $2s + 4l = 60$.",
