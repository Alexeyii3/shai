Shift right 3: $g(x)=(x-3)^2+4(x-3)-2=x^2-6x+9+4x-12-2 = x^2-2x-5$. Let me retrace my steps for the original problem leading to D. $f(x)=x^2-4x+1$. Reflect: $x^2+4x+1$. Shift right 3: $x^2-2x-2$. What if the original function was $f(x)=x^2+4x+1$? Reflect: $(-x)^2+4(-x)+1 = x^2-4x+1$. Shift right 3: $(x-3)^2-4(x-3)+1 = x^2-6x+9-4x+12+1=x^2-10x+22$. I must have made an error somewhere in my internal key. Let me solve it fresh. $f(x) = x^2-4x+1$. Reflection across y-axis gives $h(x)=f(-x)=(-x)^2-4(-x)+1=x^2+4x+1$. Shift right 3 units gives $g(x)=h(x-3)=(x-3)^2+4(x-3)+1=x^2-6x+9+4x-12+1=x^2-2x-2$. The correct answer is $x^2-2x-2$. So option C is correct. I will set the answer to C. Let's make a version where D could be correct. Maybe $f(x)=-x^2-4x+1$? Reflect: $-(-x)^2-4(-x)+1 = -x^2+4x+1$. Shift right 3: $-(x-3)^2+4(x-3)+1 = -(x^2-6x+9)+4x-12+1 = -x^2+6x-9+4x-11 = -x^2+10x-20$. Okay, I will just stick with the original question and fix the correct answer to be C."

To find $a$, use the vertex $(2, -9)$: $-9 = a(2+2)(2-6) = a(4)(-4)=-16a$. So $a=\frac{9}{16}$. Wait, my math is wrong... Let's recheck. The function is $f(x) = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2) = a(x+2)(x-6)$. The vertex is $f(2)=-9$. $-9 = a(2+2)(2-6) = a(4)(-4)=-16a$. $a=9/16$. Why isn't this an option? Let me check another way. $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k = a(x-2)^2-9$. The roots are where $f(x)=0$. $a(x-2)^2=9 \implies (x-2)^2=9/a \implies x-2=\pm\sqrt{9/a}$. $x=2\pm3/\sqrt{|a|}$. The roots are $r_1=2-3/\sqrt{|a|}$ and $r_2=2+3/\sqrt{|a|}$. The distance between them is $|r_1-r_2| = |(2-3/\sqrt{|a|})-(2+3/\sqrt{|a|})| = |-6/\sqrt{|a|}| = 6/\sqrt{|a|}$. From step 5, this distance is 8. $6/\sqrt{|a|} = 8 \implies \sqrt{|a|} = 6/8 = 3/4 \implies |a|=(3/4)^2 = 9/16$. I'm consistently getting $9/16$. Let me change the area.

OR, let's assume the remainder of the division is zero. This would mean it's not a slant asymptote, but a line with a hole. Let's assume the question is well-posed and there's a trick. Wait, maybe the value of `b` cancels or is not needed. The question asks for $a+b+c$. No, it asks for $a+b$. Let's assume there is a root, for example at $x=-1$.

Ah, perhaps the prompt implies the original numerator is perfectly divisible by the denominator except for the slant part, meaning the remainder is a constant.
