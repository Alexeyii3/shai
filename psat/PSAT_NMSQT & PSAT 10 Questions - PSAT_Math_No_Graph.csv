The table shows the cost of limestone is $0.03/lb, and the weight per volume for limestone is 120 lb/ft3. Therefore, the term [Math: 0 . 0 3 times 120 w] represents the cost, in dollars, of w ft3 of limestone. Similarly, the term [Math: 0 . 1 8 times 180 z] represents the cost, in dollars, of z ft3 of basalt. The given equation shows that the total cost of all the rocks used in the project is $7,576.20. Since it’s given that all four rock types are used in the project, the remaining term, 3,385.80, represents the cost, in dollars, of the granite and sandstone needed for the project.Choice B is incorrect. The cost of basalt and limestone needed for the project can be represented by [Math: 0 . 1 8 times 180 z, +, 0 . 0 3 times 120 w]. Choice C is incorrect. The cost of the basalt needed for the project can be represented by the expression [Math: 0 . 1 8 times 180 z].

Math,Algebra,Linear equations in one variable,Easy,"If $2 x + 3 = 9$, what is the value of $6 x - 1$?",,,,,17,17,"The correct answer is $17$. It’s given that $2 x + 3 = 9$. Multiplying each side of this equation by $3$ yields $3 \left(2 x + 3\right) = 3 \left(9\right)$, or $6 x + 9 = 27$. Subtracting $10$ from each side of this equation yields $6 x + 9 - 10 = 27 - 10$, or $6 x - 1 = 17$. Therefore, the value of $6 x - 1$ is $17$."
Math,Algebra,Systems of two linear equations in two variables,Medium,$y = 2 x + 10$ $y = 2 x - 1$ At how many points do the graphs of the given equations intersect in the xy-plane?,Zero,Exactly one,Exactly two,Infinitely many,A,,"Choice A is correct. A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has zero points of intersection if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel. The graphs of two lines in the xy-plane represented by equations in slope-intercept form, $y = m x + b$, are distinct if the y-coordinates of their y-intercepts, $b$, are different and are parallel if their slopes, $m$, are the same. For the two equations in the given system, $y = 2 x + 10$ and $y = 2 x - 1$, the values of $b$ are $10$ and $- 1$, respectively, and the values of $m$ are both $2$. Since the values of $b$ are different, the graphs of these lines have different y-coordinates of the y-intercept and are distinct. Since the values of $m$ are the same, the graphs of these lines have the same slope and are parallel. Therefore, the graphs of the given equations are lines that intersect at zero points in the xy-plane. Choice B is incorrect. The graphs of a system of two linear equations have exactly one point of intersection if the lines represented by the equations have different slopes. Since the given equations represent lines with the same slope, there is not exactly one intersection point. Choice C is incorrect. The graphs of a system of two linear equations can never have exactly two intersection points. Choice D is incorrect. The graphs of a system of two linear equations have infinitely many intersection points when the lines represented by the equations have the same slope and the same y-coordinate of the y-intercept. Since the given equations represent lines with different y-coordinates of their y-intercepts, there are not infinitely many intersection points."

It's given that $68 x + 85 y = 1,258$ represents the situation where an interior designer earned a total of $\$ 1,258$ last week from consulting for $x$ hours and drawing up plans for $y$ hours. Thus, $68 x$ represents the amount earned, in dollars, from consulting for $x$ hours, and $85 y$ represents the amount earned, in dollars, from drawing up plans for $y$ hours. Since $68 x$ represents the amount earned, in dollars, from consulting for $x$ hours, it follows that the interior designer earned $\$ 68$ per hour consulting last week. Choice B is incorrect.

It is given that the relationship between population and year is linear; therefore, the function that models the population t years after 2000 is of the form [Math: P of t =, m, t + b], where m is the slope and b is the population when [Math: t = 0]. In the year 2000, [Math: t = 0]. Therefore, [Math: b = 862]. The slope is given by [Math: m =, the fraction with numerator P of 10, minus P of 0, and denominator 10 minus 0, end fraction, which = the fraction with numerator 846 minus 862, and denominator 10 minus 0, end fraction, which = - 16 over 10, which = - 1 . 6].

Math,Algebra,Linear functions,Hard,"A linear function $f$ gives a company’s profit, in dollars, for selling $x$ items. The company’s profit is $\$ 220$ when it sells $8$ items, and its profit is $\$ 320$ when it sells $10$ items. Which equation defines $f$?",$f ( x ) = 150 x - 320$,$f ( x ) = 32 x$,$f ( x ) = 50 x - 10 x$,$f ( x ) = 50 x - 180$,D,,"Choice D is correct. It’s given that the relationship between $x$ and $f \left(x\right)$ is linear. A linear function can be written in the form $f \left(x\right) = m x + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane. Given two points on a line, $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, the slope of the line can be found using the slope formula $m = \frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}$. It’s given that the company’s profit is $\$ 220$ when it sells $8$ items and the profit is $\$ 320$ when it sells $10$ items. Since $f \left(x\right)$ represents the company's profit, in dollars, for selling $x$ items, the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane passes through the points $\left(8 , 220\right)$ and $\left(10 , 320\right)$. Substituting $\left(8 , 220\right)$ and $\left(10 , 320\right)$ for $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, respectively, in the slope formula yields $m = \frac{320 - 220}{10 - 8}$, which gives $m = \frac{100}{2}$, or $m = 50$. Substituting $50$ for $m$, $8$ for $x$, and $220$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in $f \left(x\right) = m x + b$ yields $220 = \left(50\right) \left(8\right) + b$, or $220 = 400 + b$. Subtracting $400$ from each side of this equation yields $- 180 = b$. Substituting $50$ for $m$ and $- 180$ for $b$ in $f \left(x\right) = m x + b$ yields $f \left(x\right) = 50 x - 180$. Therefore, the equation that defines $f$ is $f \left(x\right) = 50 x - 180$. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

Math,Algebra,Systems of two linear equations in two variables,Hard,"$\frac{7}{8} y - \frac{5}{8} x = \frac{4}{7} - \frac{7}{8} y$ $\frac{5}{4} x + \frac{7}{4} = p y + \frac{15}{4}$ In the given system of equations, $p$ is a constant. If the system has no solution, what is the value of $p$?",,,,,"3.5, 7/2","3.5, 7/2","The correct answer is $\frac{7}{2}$. A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel. Two lines represented by equations in standard form $A x + B y = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants, are parallel if the coefficients for $x$ and $y$ in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation. The first equation in the given system, $\frac{7}{8} y - \frac{5}{8} x = \frac{4}{7} - \frac{7}{8} y$, can be written in standard form by adding $\frac{7}{8} y$ to both sides of the equation, which yields $\frac{14}{8} y - \frac{5}{8} x = \frac{4}{7}$, or $- \frac{5}{8} x + \frac{14}{8} y = \frac{4}{7}$. Multiplying each term in this equation by $- 8$ yields $5 x - 14 y = - \frac{32}{7}$. The second equation in the given system, $\frac{5}{4} x + \frac{7}{4} = p y + \frac{15}{4}$, can be written in standard form by subtracting $\frac{7}{4}$ and $p y$ from both sides of the equation, which yields $\frac{5}{4} x - p y = \frac{8}{4}$. Multiplying each term in this equation by $4$ yields $5 x - 4 p y = 8$. The coefficient of $x$ in the first equation, $5 x - 14 y = - \frac{32}{7}$, is equal to the coefficient of $x$ in the second equation, $5 x - 4 p y = 8$. For the lines to be parallel, and for the coefficients for $x$ and $y$ in one equation to be proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, the coefficient of $y$ in the second equation must also be equal to the coefficient of $y$ in the first equation. Therefore, $- 14 = - 4 p$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $- 4$ yields $\frac{- 14}{- 4} = p$, or $p = \frac{7}{2}$. Therefore, if the given system of equations has no solution, the value of $p$ is $\frac{7}{2}$. Note that 7/2 and 3.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer."

This means that the slope of line $r$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line $p$. If the equation for line $p$ is rewritten in slope-intercept form $y = m x + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, then $m$ is the slope of the line and $\left(0 , b\right)$ is its y-intercept. Subtracting $18 x$ from both sides of the equation $2 y + 18 x = 9$ yields $2 y = - 18 x + 9$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $y = - 9 x + \frac{9}{2}$. It follows that the slope of line $p$ is $- 9$. The negative reciprocal of a number is $- 1$ divided by the number. Therefore, the negative reciprocal of $- 9$ is $\frac{- 1}{- 9}$, or $\frac{1}{9}$.

A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, $A x + B y = C$ and $D x + E y = F$, are parallel if the coefficients for $x$ and $y$ in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning $\frac{D}{A} = \frac{E}{B}$; and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning $\frac{F}{C}$ is not equal to $\frac{D}{A}$ or $\frac{E}{B}$. The first equation in the given system is $\frac{3}{2} y - \frac{1}{4} x = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{3}{2} y$. Multiplying each side of this equation by $12$ yields $18 y - 3 x = 8 - 18 y$. Adding $18 y$ to each side of this equation yields $36 y - 3 x = 8$, or $- 3 x + 36 y = 8$. The second equation in the given system is $\frac{1}{2} x + \frac{3}{2} = p y + \frac{9}{2}$. Multiplying each side of this equation by $2$ yields $x + 3 = 2 p y + 9$. Subtracting $2 p y$ from each side of this equation yields $x + 3 - 2 p y = 9$. Subtracting $3$ from each side of this equation yields $x - 2 p y = 6$. Therefore, the two equations in the given system, written in standard form, are $- 3 x + 36 y = 8$ and$ x - 2 p y = 6$. As previously stated, if this system has no solution, the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct, meaning the proportion $\frac{1}{- 3} = \frac{- 2 p}{36}$, or $- \frac{1}{3} = - \frac{p}{18}$, is true and the proportion $\frac{6}{8} = \frac{1}{- 3}$ is not true. The proportion $\frac{6}{8} = \frac{1}{- 3}$ is not true. Multiplying each side of the true proportion, $- \frac{1}{3} = - \frac{p}{18}$, by $- 18$ yields $6 = p$.

Substituting $3$ for $y$ in the equation $10 x + 7 y = 27$ yields $10 x + 7 \left(3\right) = 27$, or $10 x + 21 = 27$. Subtracting $21$ from both sides of this equation yields $10 x = 6$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $10$ yields $x = \frac{6}{10}$, or $x = \frac{3}{5}$. Therefore, the value of $x y$ is $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \left(3\right)$, or $\frac{9}{5}$.

Lines represented by equations in standard form, $A x + B y = C$ and $D x + E y = F$, are parallel if the coefficients for $x$ and $y$ in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning $\frac{D}{A} = \frac{E}{B}$; and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning $\frac{F}{C}$ is not equal to $\frac{D}{A}$ or $\frac{E}{B}$. The given equation, $y = 6 x + 18$, can be written in standard form by subtracting $6 x$ from both sides of the equation to yield $- 6 x + y = 18$. Therefore, the given equation can be written in the form $A x + B y = C$, where $A = - 6$, $B = 1$, and $C = 18$. The equation in choice B, $- 6 x + y = 22$, is written in the form $D x + E y = F$, where $D = - 6$, $E = 1$, and $F = 22$. Therefore, $\frac{D}{A} = \frac{- 6}{- 6}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{D}{A} = 1$; $\frac{E}{B} = \frac{1}{1}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{E}{B} = 1$; and $\frac{F}{C} = \frac{22}{18}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{F}{C} = \frac{11}{9}$. Since $\frac{D}{A} = 1$, $\frac{E}{B} = 1$, and $\frac{F}{C}$ is not equal to $1$, it follows that the given equation and the equation $- 6 x + y = 22$ are parallel and distinct. Therefore, a system of two linear equations consisting of the given equation and the equation $- 6 x + y = 22$ has no solution. Thus, the equation in choice B could be the second equation in the system. Choice A is incorrect. The equation $- 6 x + y = 18$ and the given equation represent the same line in the xy-plane. Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have infinitely many solutions, rather than no solution. Choice C is incorrect. The equation $- 12 x + y = 36$ and the given equation represent lines in the xy-plane that are distinct and not parallel. Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have exactly one solution, rather than no solution. Choice D is incorrect. The equation $- 12 x + y = 18$ and the given equation represent lines in the xy-plane that are distinct and not parallel. Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have exactly one solution, rather than no solution."
Math,Algebra,Systems of two linear equations in two variables,Hard,"Two customers purchased the same kind of bread and eggs at a store. The first customer paid $12.45$ dollars for $1$ loaf of bread and $2$ dozen eggs. The second customer paid $19.42$ dollars for $4$ loaves of bread and $1$ dozen eggs. What is the cost, in dollars, of $1$ dozen eggs?",$3.77$,$3.88$,$4.15$,$4.34$,D,,"Choice D is correct. Let $\mathcal{l}$ represent the cost, in dollars, of $1$ loaf of bread, and let $d$ represent the cost, in dollars, of $1$ dozen eggs. It’s given that the first customer paid $12.45$ dollars for $1$ loaf of bread and $2$ dozen eggs. Therefore, the first customer’s purchase can be represented by the equation $\mathcal{l} + 2 d = 12.45$. It’s also given that the second customer paid $19.42$ dollars for $4$ loaves of bread and $1$ dozen eggs. Therefore, the second customer’s purchase can be represented by the equation $4 \mathcal{l} + d = 19.42$. The equations $\mathcal{l} + 2 d = 12.45$ and $4 \mathcal{l} + d = 19.42$ form a system of linear equations, which can be solved by elimination to find the value of $d$. Multiplying the first equation in the system by $- 4$ yields $- 4 \mathcal{l} - 8 d = - 49.8$. Adding $- 4 \mathcal{l} - 8 d = - 49.8$ to the second equation, $4 \mathcal{l} + d = 19.42$, yields $\left(- 4 \mathcal{l} + 4 \mathcal{l}\right) + \left(- 8 d + d\right) = \left(- 49.8 + 19.42\right)$, which is equivalent to $- 7 d = - 30.38$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $- 7$ yields $d = 4.34$. Therefore, the cost, in dollars, of $1$ dozen eggs is $4.34$. Choice A is incorrect.

What is the slope of line $r$?,,,,,".5, 1/2",".5, 1/2","The correct answer is $\frac{1}{2}$. For an equation in slope-intercept form $y = m x + b$, $m$ represents the slope of the line in the xy-plane defined by this equation. It's given that line $p$ is defined by $4 y + 8 x = 6$. Subtracting $8 x$ from both sides of this equation yields $4 y = - 8 x + 6$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $y = - \frac{8}{4} x + \frac{6}{4}$, or $y = - 2 x + \frac{3}{2}$. Thus, the slope of line $p$ is $- 2$. If line $r$ is perpendicular to line $p$, then the slope of line $r$ is the negative reciprocal of the slope of line $p$.

It’s given that the truck can tow a trailer if the combined weight of the trailer and the boxes it contains is no more than $4,600$ pounds. If the trailer has a weight of $500$ pounds and each box weighs $120$ pounds, the expression $500 + 120 b$, where $b$ is the number of boxes, gives the combined weight of the trailer and the boxes. Since the combined weight must be no more than $4,600$ pounds, the possible numbers of boxes the truck can tow are given by the inequality $500 + 120 b \leq 4,600$. Subtracting $500$ from both sides of this inequality yields $120 b \leq 4,100$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by $120$ yields $b \leq \frac{205}{6}$, or $b$ is less than or equal to approximately $34.17$.

Substituting [Math: - x + 60] for y in the equation [Math: 2 x + 4 y, = 202] yields [Math: 2 x +, 4 times, open parenthesis, - x + 60, close parenthesis, = 202].

A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the graphs of the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel. The graphs of two lines in the xy-plane represented by equations in slope-intercept form, $y = m x + b$, where $m$ and $b$ are constants, are parallel if their slopes, $m$, are the same and are distinct if their y-coordinates of the y-intercepts, $b$, are different. In the equations $y = 16 x + 3$ and $y = 16 x + 19$, the values of $m$ are each $16$, and the values of $b$ are $3$ and $19$, respectively. Since the slopes of these lines are the same, and the y-coordinates of the y-intercepts are different, it follows that the system of linear equations in choice C has no solution.

If Vivian bought $10$ packages of party hats, how many cupcakes did she buy?",,,,,41,41,"The correct answer is $41$. The number of cupcakes Vivian bought can be found by first finding the amount Vivian spent on cupcakes. The amount Vivian spent on cupcakes can be found by subtracting the amount Vivian spent on party hats from the total amount Vivian spent. The amount Vivian spent on party hats can be found by multiplying the cost per package of party hats by the number of packages of party hats, which yields $\$ 3 \cdot 10$, or $\$ 30$. Subtracting the amount Vivian spent on party hats, $\$ 30$, from the total amount Vivian spent, $\$ 71$, yields $\$ 71 - \$ 30$, or $\$ 41$. Since the amount Vivian spent on cupcakes was $\$ 41$ and each cupcake cost $\$ 1$, it follows that Vivian bought $41$ cupcakes."

If the truck was driven 38 miles, what was the total amount Robert was charged?",$46.60,$52.90,$66.90,$86.50,A,,"Choice A is correct. It’s given that Robert was charged an initial fee of $20.00 to rent the truck plus an additional $0.70 per mile driven. Let m represent the number of miles the truck was driven. Since the rental charge is $0.70 per mile driven, [Math: 0 . 7 0 m] represents the amount Robert was charged for m miles driven. Let c equal the total amount, in dollars, Robert was charged to rent the truck. The total amount can be represented by the equation [Math: c =, 20 . 0 0 + 0 . 7 0 m]. It’s given that the truck was driven 38 miles, thus [Math: m = 38]. Substituting 38 into the equation gives [Math: c =, 20 . 0 0 + 0 . 7 0, times 38].

Math,Algebra,Systems of two linear equations in two variables,Hard,"A movie theater sells two types of tickets, adult tickets for $12 and child tickets for $8. If the theater sold 30 tickets for a total of $300, how much, in dollars, was spent on adult tickets? (Disregard the $ sign when gridding your answer.)",,,,,,,"The correct answer is 180. Let a be the number of adult tickets sold and c be the number of child tickets sold. Since the theater sold a total of 30 tickets, a + c = 30. The price per adult ticket is $12, and the price per child ticket is $8. Since the theater received a total of $300 for the 30 tickets sold, it follows that 12a + 8c = 300. To eliminate c, the first equation can be multiplied by 8 and then subtracted from the second equation: [Math: 12 a, + 8 c, = 300, and - 8 a, minus 8 c, = - 240, gives 4 a, + 0 c, = 60]Because the question asks for the amount spent on adult tickets, which is 12a dollars, the resulting equation can be multiplied by 3 to give 3(4a) = 3(60) = 180. Therefore, $180 was spent on adult tickets.Alternate approach: If all the 30 tickets sold were child tickets, their total price would be 30($8) = $240. Since the actual total price of the 30 tickets was $300, the extra $60 indicates that a certain number of adult tickets, a, were sold. Since the price of each adult ticket is $4 more than each child ticket, 4a = 60, and it follows that 12a = 180."

Substituting $0$ for $y$ in the equation $y = 4 x + 28$ yields $0 = 4 x + 28$. Subtracting $28$ from both sides of this equation yields $- 28 = 4 x$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $- 7 = x$. Therefore, the x-intercept of the graph of $y = h \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane is $\left(- 7 , 0\right)$.

It’s also given that the model estimates the population was $57$ thousand in $1991$, $224$ thousand in $2011$, and $x$ thousand in $2015$. The change in the population between $2011$ and $1991$ is $224 - 57$, or $167$, thousand. The change in the number of years between $2011$ and $1991$ is $2011 - 1991$, or $20$, years.

Multiplying both sides of the equation for store B by $5.5$ yields $\left(6 . 50 r\right) \left(5 . 5\right) + \left(8 . 00 b\right) \left(5 . 5\right) = \left(66 . 00\right) \left(5 . 5\right)$, or $35 . 75 r + 44 b = 363$. Subtracting both sides of the equation for store A, $35 . 75 r + 19 . 5 b = 240 . 5$, from the corresponding sides of the equation for store B, $35 . 75 r + 44 b = 363$, yields $\left(35 . 75 r - 35 . 75 r\right) + \left(44 b - 19 . 5 b\right) = \left(363 - 240 . 5\right)$, or $24 . 5 b = 122 . 5$. Dividing both sides of this equationby $24.5$ yields $b = 5$. Thus, $5$ pints of blackberries are inthis purchase. Choices A and B are incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

It’s given that the equation $y - 5 x = 6$ represents the relationship between the number of suits that Kaylani made, $x$, and the total length of fabric she purchased, $y$, in yards. Adding $5 x$ to both sides of the given equation yields $y = 5 x + 6$. Since Kaylani made $x$ suits and used $5$ yards of fabric to make each suit, the expression $5 x$ represents the total amount of fabric she used to make the suits. Since $y$ represents the total length of fabric Kaylani purchased, in yards, it follows from the equation $y = 5 x + 6$ that Kaylani purchased $5 x$ yards of fabric to make the suits, plus an additional $6$ yards of fabric. Therefore, the best interpretation of $6$ in this context is that Kaylani purchased $6$ yards more fabric than she used to make the suits. Choice A is incorrect.

Based on the article, how many hours should the adult hike to use a total of 1,900 calories from bicycling and hiking?",9.5,8.75,6,4,D,,"Choice D is correct. Since a 160-pound adult uses 200 calories for every 30 minutes of hiking, then the same adult uses [Math: 200 h] calories after hiking for h 30-minute periods. Similarly, the same adult uses [Math: 150 b] calories after bicycling for b 30-minute periods. Therefore, the equation [Math: 200 h + 150 b, = 1,900] represents the situation where a 160-pound adult uses a total of 1,900 calories from hiking for h 30-minute periods and bicycling for b 30-minute periods. It’s given that the adult completes 1 hour, or 2 30-minute periods, of bicycling. Substituting 2 for b in the equation [Math: 200 h + 150 b, = 1,900] yields [Math: 200 h +, 150 times 2, = 1,900], or [Math: 200 h + 300, = 1,900].

Multiplying both sides of the second equation in the given system by $- 2$ yields $- 2 t y = - 1 - 4 x$, or $- 1 - 4 x = - 2 t y$. Adding this equation to the first equation in the given system, $4 x - 6 y = 10 y + 2$, yields $\left(4 x - 6 y\right) + \left(- 1 - 4 x\right) = \left(10 y + 2\right) + \left(- 2 t y\right)$, or $- 1 - 6 y = 10 y - 2 t y + 2$. Subtracting $10 y$ from both sides of this equation yields $\left(- 1 - 6 y\right) - \left(10 y\right) = \left(10 y - 2 t y + 2\right) - \left(10 y\right)$, or $- 1 - 16 y = - 2 t y + 2$. If the given system has no solution, then the equation $- 1 - 16 y = - 2 t y + 2$ has no solution. If this equation has no solution, the coefficients of $y$ on each side of the equation, $- 16$ and $- 2 t$, must be equal, which yields the equation $- 16 = - 2 t$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $- 2$ yields $8 = t$. Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of $t$ is $8$. Alternate approach: A system of two linear equations in two variables, $x$ and $y$, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in the form $A x + B y = C$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constant terms, are parallel if the ratio of the x-coefficients is equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients, and distinct if the ratio of the x-coefficients are not equal to the ratio of the constant terms. Subtracting $10 y$ from both sides of the first equation in the given system yields $\left(4 x - 6 y\right) - \left(10 y\right) = \left(10 y + 2\right) - \left(10 y\right)$, or $4 x - 16 y = 2$. Subtracting $2 x$ from both sides of the second equation in the given system yields $\left(t y\right) - \left(2 x\right) = \left(\frac{1}{2} + 2 x\right) - \left(2 x\right)$, or $- 2 x + t y = \frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of the x-coefficients for these equations is $- \frac{2}{4}$, or $- \frac{1}{2}$. The ratio of the y-coefficients for these equations is $- \frac{t}{16}$. The ratio of the constant terms for these equations is $\frac{1/2}{2}$, or $\frac{1}{4}$. Since the ratio of the x-coefficients, $- \frac{1}{2}$, is not equal to the ratio of the constants, $\frac{1}{4}$, the lines represented by the equations are distinct. Setting the ratio of the x-coefficients equal to the ratio of the y-coefficients yields $- \frac{1}{2} = - \frac{t}{16}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $- 16$ yields $\left(- \frac{1}{2}\right) \left(- 16\right) = \left(- \frac{t}{16}\right) \left(- 16\right)$, or $t = 8$. Therefore, when $t = 8$, the lines represented by these equations are parallel. Thus, if the system has no solution, the value of $t$ is $8$."

Math,Algebra,Linear equations in two variables,Medium,A city’s total expense budget for one year was x million dollars. The city budgeted y million dollars for departmental expenses and 201 million dollars for all other expenses. Which of the following represents the relationship between x and y in this context?,"[Math: x + y, = 201]","[Math: x minus y, = 201]","[Math: 2 x minus y, = 201]","[Math: y minus x, = 201]",B,,"Choice B is correct. Of the city’s total expense budget for one year, the city budgeted y million dollars for departmental expenses and 201 million dollars for all other expenses. This means that the expression [Math: y + 201] represents the total expense budget, in millions of dollars, for one year. It’s given that the total expense budget for one year is x million dollars. It follows then that the expression [Math: y + 201] is equivalent to x, or [Math: y + 201, = x]. Subtracting y from both sides of this equation yields [Math: 201 =, x minus y]. By the symmetric property of equality, this is the same as [Math: x minus y, = 201].Choices A and C are incorrect. Because it’s given that the total expense budget for one year, x million dollars, is comprised of the departmental expenses, y million dollars, and all other expenses, 201 million dollars, the expressions [Math: x + y] and [Math: 2 x minus y] both must be equivalent to a value greater than 201 million dollars. Therefore, the equations [Math: x + y, = 201]and [Math: 2 x minus y, = 201]aren’t true. Choice D is incorrect. The value of x must be greater than the value of y.

Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning that the slope of the first line is equal to $- 1$ divided by the slope of the second line. Each equation in the given pair of equations can be written in slope-intercept form, $y = m x + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the graph of the equation in the xy-plane and $\left(0 , b\right)$ is the y-intercept. For the first equation, $5 x + 7 y = 1$, subtracting $5 x$ from both sides gives $7 y = - 5 x + 1$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $7$ gives $y = - \frac{5}{7} x + \frac{1}{7}$. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is $- \frac{5}{7}$. For the second equation, $a x + b y = 1$, subtracting $a x$ from both sides gives $b y = - a x + 1$, and dividing both sides of this equation by $b$ gives $y = - \frac{a}{b} x + \frac{1}{b}$. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is $- \frac{a}{b}$. Since the graph of the given pair of equations is a pair of perpendicular lines, the slope of the graph of the second equation, $- \frac{a}{b}$, must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the graph of the first equation, $- \frac{5}{7}$. The negative reciprocal of $- \frac{5}{7}$ is $\frac{- 1}{\left(- \frac{5}{7}\right)}$, or $\frac{7}{5}$. Therefore, $- \frac{a}{b} = \frac{7}{5}$, or $\frac{a}{b} = - \frac{7}{5}$. Similarly, rewriting the equations in choice B in slope-intercept form yields $y = - \frac{10}{7} x + \frac{1}{7}$ and $y = - \frac{a}{2 b} x + \frac{1}{2 b}$. It follows that the slope of the graph of the first equation in choice B is $- \frac{10}{7}$ and the slope of the graph of the second equation in choice B is $- \frac{a}{2 b}$. Since $\frac{a}{b} = - \frac{7}{5}$, $- \frac{a}{2 b}$ is equal to $- \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(- \frac{7}{5}\right)$, or $\frac{7}{10}$. Since $\frac{7}{10}$ is the negative reciprocal of $- \frac{10}{7}$, the pair of equations in choice B represents a pair of perpendicular lines.

It’s given that the candle starts with $17$ ounces of wax and has $6$ ounces of wax remaining after a period of time has passed. The amount of wax the candle has lost during the time period can be found by subtracting the remaining amount of wax from the amount of wax the candle was made of, which yields $17 - 6$ ounces, or $11$ ounces. This means the candle loses $11$ ounces of wax during that period of time. It’s given that the amount of wax decreases by $1$ ounce every $4$ hours. If $h$ represents the number of hours the candle has been burning, it follows that $\frac{1}{4} = \frac{11}{h}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $4 h$ yields $h = 44$.

The company’s revenue is $80$ dollars per adult and $60$ dollars per child. If the company’s revenue for one group consisting of adults and children was $1,440$ dollars, how many people in the group were children?",$3$,$9$,$12$,$18$,C,,"Choice C is correct. Let $x$ represent the number of children in a whale-watching tour group. Let $y$ represent the number of adults in this group. Because it's given that $21$ people are in a group and the group consists of adults and children, it must be true that $x + y = 21$. Since the company's revenue is $60$ dollars per child, the total revenue from $x$ children in this group was $60 x$ dollars. Since the company's revenue is $80$ dollars per adult, the total revenue from $y$ adults in this group was $80 y$ dollars. Because it's given that the total revenue for this group was $1,440$ dollars, it must be true that $60 x + 80 y = 1,440$. The equations $x + y = 21$ and $60 x + 80 y = 1,440$ form a linear system of equations that can be solved to find the value of $x$, which represents the number of children in the group, using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the equation $x + y = 21$ by $80$ yields $80 x + 80 y = 1,680$. Subtracting $60 x + 80 y = 1,440$ from $80 x + 80 y = 1,680$ yields $\left(\right. 80 x + 80 y \left.\right) - \left(\right. 60 x + 80 y \left.\right) = 1,680 - 1,440$, which is equivalent to $80 x - 60 x + 80 y - 80 y = 240$, or $20 x = 240$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $20$ yields $x = 12$. Therefore, $12$ people in the group were children. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect. This is the number of adults in the group, not the number of children in the group. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

Each of the tables gives the same three values of $x$: $1$, $2$, and $4$. Substituting $1$ for $x$ in the given equation yields $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \left(1\right) + \frac{3}{4} y = 7$, or $\frac{3}{5} + \frac{3}{4} y = \frac{35}{5}$. Subtracting $\frac{3}{5}$ from both sides of this equation yields $\frac{3}{4} y = \frac{32}{5}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $\frac{4}{3}$ yields $y = \frac{128}{15}$. Therefore, when $x = 1$, the corresponding value of $y$ for the given equation is $\frac{128}{15}$. Substituting $2$ for $x$ in the given equation yields $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \left(2\right) + \frac{3}{4} y = 7$, or $\frac{6}{5} + \frac{3}{4} y = \frac{35}{5}$. Subtracting $\frac{6}{5}$ from both sides of this equation yields $\frac{3}{4} y = \frac{29}{5}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $\frac{4}{3}$ yields $y = \frac{116}{15}$. Therefore, when $x = 2$, the corresponding value of $y$ for the given equation is $\frac{116}{15}$. Substituting $4$ for $x$ in the given equation yields $\left(\frac{3}{5}\right) \left(4\right) + \frac{3}{4} y = 7$, or $\frac{12}{5} + \frac{3}{4} y = \frac{35}{5}$. Subtracting $\frac{12}{5}$ from both sides of this equation yields $\frac{3}{4} y = \frac{23}{5}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $\frac{4}{3}$ yields $y = \frac{92}{15}$. Therefore, when $x = 4$, the corresponding value of $y$ for the given equation is $\frac{92}{15}$. The table in choice D gives x-values of $1$, $2$, and $4$ and corresponding y-values of $\frac{128}{15}$, $\frac{116}{15}$, and $\frac{92}{15}$, respectively.

Avery earns $10 per hour working at job A. Therefore, if she works a hours at job A, she will earn [Math: 10 a] dollars. Avery earns $20 per hour working at job B. Therefore, if she works b hours at job B, she will earn [Math: 20 b] dollars. The graph shown represents all possible combinations of the number of hours Avery could have worked at the two jobs to earn s dollars. Therefore, if she worked a hours at job A, worked b hours at job B, and earned s dollars from both jobs, the following equation represents the graph: [Math: 10 a, + 20 b, = s], where s is a constant. Identifying any point [Math: with coordinates a, , b] from the graph and substituting the values of the coordinates for a and b, respectively, in this equation yield the value of s.

Therefore, [Math: the . with coordinates 16 , 0] doesn’t satisfy the equation, and so the value of s can’t be 128. Similarly, if [Math: s = 200] (choice C) or [Math: s = 320] (choice D), then substituting 16 for a and 0 for b yields [Math: 160 = 200] and [Math: 160 = 320], respectively, which are both false."

The number of containers in a shipment must have a weight less than or equal to 300 pounds. The total weight, in pounds, of detergent and fabric softener that the supplier delivers can be expressed as the weight of each container multiplied by the number of each type of container, which is 7.35d for detergent and 6.2s for fabric softener. Since this total cannot exceed 300 pounds, it follows that [Math: 7 . 3 5 d, + 6 . 2 s, is less than or equal to 300]. Also, since the laundry service wants to buy at least twice as many containers of detergent as containers of fabric softener, the number of containers of detergent should be greater than or equal to two times the number of containers of fabric softener.

Let $x$ represent the total mass, in grams, of the first piece, and let $y$ represent the total mass, in grams, of the second piece. It's given that the sample has a total mass of $50.0$ grams. Therefore, the equation $x + y = 50.0$ represents this situation. It's also given that the sample is $50.0 \%$ silicon by mass. Therefore, the total mass of the silicon in the sample is $0.500 \left(50.0\right)$, or $25.0$, grams. It's also given that the first piece was $30.0 \%$ silicon by mass and the second piece was $80.0 \%$ silicon by mass. Therefore, the masses, in grams, of the silicon in the first and second pieces can be represented by the expressions $0.300 x$ and $0.800 y$, respectively. Since the sample was created by combining the first and second pieces, and the total mass of the silicon in the sample is $25.0$ grams, the equation $0.300 x + 0.800 y = 25.0$ represents this situation. Subtracting $y$ from both sides of the equation $x + y = 50.0$ yields $x = 50.0 - y$. Substituting $50.0 - y$ for $x$ in the equation $0.300 x + 0.800 y = 25.0$ yields $0.300 \left(50.0 - y\right) + 0.800 y = 25.0$.

Subtracting $15.0$ from both sides of this equation yields $0.500 y = 10.0$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $0.500$ yields $y = 20.0$. Substituting $20.0$ for $y$ in the expression representing the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the second piece, $0.800 y$, yields $0.800 \left(20.0\right)$, or $16.0$. Therefore, the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the second piece is $16.0$. Choice A is incorrect. This is the mass, in grams, of the silicon in the first piece, not the second piece.

Let $s$ represent the number of small candles the owner can purchase, and let $\mathcal{l}$ represent the number of large candles the owner can purchase. It’s given that the owner pays $\$ 4.90$ per candle to purchase small candles and $\$ 11.60$ per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays $4.90 s$ dollars for $s$ small candles and $11.60 \mathcal{l}$ dollars for $\mathcal{l}$ large candles, which means the owner pays a total of $4.90 s + 11.60 \mathcal{l}$ dollars to purchase candles. It’s given that the owner budgets $\$ 2,200$ to purchase candles. Therefore, $4.90 s + 11.60 \mathcal{l} \leq 2,200$. It’s also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of $200$ candles. Therefore, $s + \mathcal{l} \geq 200$. The inequalities $4.90 s + 11.60 \mathcal{l} \leq 2,200$ and $s + \mathcal{l} \geq 200$ can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting $\mathcal{l}$ from both sides of the inequality $s + \mathcal{l} \geq 200$ yields $s \geq 200 - \mathcal{l}$. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by $4.90$ yields $4.90 s \geq 4.90 \left(200 - \mathcal{l}\right)$, or $4.90 s \geq 980 - 4.90 \mathcal{l}$.

This inequality can be combined with the inequality $4.90 s + 11.60 \mathcal{l} \leq 2,200$, which yields the compound inequality $980 + 6.70 \mathcal{l} \leq 4.90 s + 11.60 \mathcal{l} \leq 2,200$. It follows that $980 + 6.70 \mathcal{l} \leq 2,200$. Subtracting $980$ from both sides of this inequality yields $6.70 \mathcal{l} \leq 2,200$. Dividing both sides of this inequality by $6.70$ yields approximately $\mathcal{l} \leq 182.09$.

It’s given that the window repair specialist charges $\$ 220$ for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. Let $n$ represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours. Since it’s given that $x$ is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression $n \left(x - 2\right)$. Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for $x$ hours of repair is $ f \left(x\right) = 220 + n \left(x - 2\right)$. It’s given that the total cost for $5$ hours of repair is $\$ 400$. Substituting $5$ for $x$ and $400$ for $f \left(x\right)$ into the equation $ f \left(x\right) = 220 + n \left(x - 2\right)$ yields $400 = 220 + n \left(5 - 2\right)$, or $400 = 220 + 3 n$. Subtracting $220$ from both sides of this equation yields $180 = 3 n$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $3$ yields $n = 60$. Substituting $60$ for $n$ in the equation $ f \left(x\right) = 220 + n \left(x - 2\right)$ yields $ f \left(x\right) = 220 + 60 \left(x - 2\right)$, which is equivalent to $ f \left(x\right) = 220 + 60 x - 120$, or $ f \left(x\right) = 60 x + 100$.

This equation can be written in slope-intercept form $y = m x + b$, where $m$ is the slope of line $h$ and $b$ is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of line $h$. Adding $70$ to both sides of $\frac{1}{5} x + \frac{1}{7} y - 70 = 0$ yields $\frac{1}{5} x + \frac{1}{7} y = 70$. Subtracting $\frac{1}{5} x$ from both sides of this equation yields $\frac{1}{7} y = - \frac{1}{5} x + 70$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $7$ yields $y = - \frac{7}{5} x + 490$. Therefore, the slope of line $h$ is $- \frac{7}{5}$. It’s given that line $j$ is perpendicular to line $h$ in the xy-plane.

Since the first two terms of this expression have a common factor of $57 x$ and the last two terms of this expression have a common factor of $a$, this expression can be rewritten as $57 x \left(x + b\right) + a \left(x + b\right)$.

Let x be the number of years after 1985. It follows that [Math: x over 2] represents the number of 2-year periods that will occur within an x-year period. According to Moore’s law, every 2 years, the number of transistors included on microprocessors is estimated to double. Therefore, x years after 1985, the number of transistors will double [Math: x over 2] times. Since the number of transistors included on a microprocessor was 275,000, or .275 million, in 1985, the estimated number of transistors, in millions, included x years after 1985 can be modeled as [Math: 0 . 2 7 5 times 2 raised to the x over 2 power]. The year in which the number of transistors is estimated to be 1.1 million is represented by the value of x when [Math: 1 . 1 =, 0 . 2 7 5, times 2 raised to the x over 2 power].

Multiplying the width, $x$ inches, by the length, $7 x - 4$ inches, yields $x \left(7 x - 4\right)$ square inches. It’s given that the rectangle has an area of $155$ square inches, so it follows that $x \left(7 x - 4\right) = 155$, or $7 x^{2} - 4 x = 155$. Subtracting $155$ from both sides of this equation yields $7 x^{2} - 4 x - 155 = 0$. Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields $\left(7 x + 31\right) \left(x - 5\right) = 0$. Applying the zero product property to this equation yields two solutions: $x = - \frac{31}{7}$ and $x = 5$.

In the xy-plane, a parabola is a symmetric graph such that when two points have the same y-coordinate, these points are equidistant from the vertex, and the x-coordinate of the vertex is halfway between the x-coordinates of these two points.

Math,Advanced Math,Nonlinear functions,Hard,"A quadratic function models a projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. The model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. How many seconds after the launch does the model estimate that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters?",$3$,$6$,$7$,$9$,B,,"Choice B is correct. It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It follows that an equation representing the model can be written in the form $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$, where $f \left(x\right)$ is the projectile's estimated height above the ground, in meters, $x$ seconds after the launch, $a$ is a constant, and $k$ is the maximum height above the ground, in meters, the model estimates the projectile reached $h$ seconds after the launch. It's given that the model estimates the projectile reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Therefore, $k = 51.1$ and $h = 3$. Substituting $51.1$ for $k$ and $3$ for $h$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$ yields $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - 3\right)^{2} + 51.1$. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground. Therefore, when $x = 0$, $f \left(x\right) = 7$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $7$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - 3\right)^{2} + 51.1$ yields $7 = a \left(0 - 3\right)^{2} + 51.1$, or $7 = 9 a + 51.1$. Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $- 44.1 = 9 a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $9$ yields $- 4.9 = a$. Substituting $- 4.9$ for $a$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - 3\right)^{2} + 51.1$ yields $f \left(x\right) = - 4.9 \left(x - 3\right)^{2} + 51.1$. Therefore, the equation $f \left(x\right) = - 4.9 \left(x - 3\right)^{2} + 51.1$ models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground $x$ seconds after it was launched. The number of seconds after the launch that the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters is the value of $x$ when $f \left(x\right) = 7$. Substituting $7$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in $f \left(x\right) = - 4.9 \left(x - 3\right)^{2} + 51.1$ yields $7 = - 4.9 \left(x - 3\right)^{2} + 51.1$. Subtracting $51.1$ from both sides of this equation yields $- 44.1 = - 4.9 \left(x - 3\right)^{2}$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $- 4.9$ yields $9 = \left(x - 3\right)^{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two equations: $3 = x - 3$ and $- 3 = x - 3$. Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $3 = x - 3$ yields $6 = x$. Adding $3$ to both sides of the equation $- 3 = x - 3$ yields $0 = x$. Since $0$ seconds after the launch represents the time at which the projectile was launched, $6$ must be the number of seconds the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters. Alternate approach: It's given that a quadratic function models the projectile's height, in meters, above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after it was launched. It's also given that the model estimates that the projectile was launched from an initial height of $7$ meters above the ground and reached a maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground $3$ seconds after the launch. Since the model is quadratic, and quadratic functions are symmetric, the model estimates that for any given height less than the maximum height, the time the projectile takes to travel from the given height to the maximum height is the same as the time the projectile takes to travel from the maximum height back to the given height. Thus, since the model estimates the projectile took $3$ seconds to travel from $7$ meters above the ground to its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground, the model also estimates the projectile will take $3$ more seconds to travel from its maximum height of $51.1$ meters above the ground back to $7$ meters above the ground. Thus, the model estimates that the projectile will return to a height of $7$ meters $3$ seconds after it reaches its maximum height, which is $6$ seconds after the launch. Choice A is incorrect. The model estimates that $3$ seconds after the launch, the projectile reached a height of $51.1$ meters, not $7$ meters. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

Since each term of the given expression, $2 x^{3} + 42 x^{2} + 208 x$, has a factor of $2 x$, the expression can be rewritten as $2 x \left(x^{2}\right) + 2 x \left(21 x\right) + 2 x \left(104\right)$, or $2 x \left(x^{2} + 21 x + 104\right)$.

Based on the model, what is the height, in feet, of the object above the ground $10$ seconds after being launched?",$234$,$778$,$970$,"$1,014$",C,,"Choice C is correct. It's given that a quadratic function models the height, in feet, of an object above the ground in terms of the time, in seconds, after the object is launched off an elevated surface. This quadratic function can be defined by an equation of the form $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$, where $f \left(x\right)$ is the height of the object $x$ seconds after it was launched, and $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants such that the function reaches its maximum value, $k$, when $x = h$. Since the model indicates the object reaches its maximum height of $1,034$ feet above the ground $8$ seconds after being launched, $f \left(x\right)$ reaches its maximum value, $1,034$, when $x = 8$. Therefore, $k = 1,034$ and $h = 8$. Substituting $8$ for $h$ and $1,034$ for $k$ in the function $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$ yields $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - 8\right)^{2} + 1,034$. Since the model indicates the object has an initial height of $10$ feet above the ground, the value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $10$ when $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ and $10$ for $f \left(x\right)$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - 8\right)^{2} + 1,034$ yields $10 = a \left(0 - 8\right)^{2} + 1,034$, or $10 = 64 a + 1,034$. Subtracting $1,034$ from both sides of this equation yields $64 a = - 1,024$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $64$ yields $a = - 16$. Therefore, the model can be represented by the equation $f \left(x\right) = - 16 \left(x - 8\right)^{2} + 1,034$. Substituting $10$ for $x$ in this equation yields $f \left(10\right) = - 16 \left(10 - 8\right)^{2} + 1,034$, or $f \left(10\right) = 970$. Therefore, based on the model, $10$ seconds after being launched, the height of the object above the ground is $970$ feet. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

It's given that an exponential model estimates that the number of comments on an article increased by a fixed percentage at the end of each hour. Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form $C = K a^{t}$, where $C$ is the estimated number of comments on the article $t$ hours after the article was first featured on the home page and $K$ and $a$ are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were $40$ comments on the article. This means that when $t = 0$, $C = 40$. Substituting $0$ for $t$ and $40$ for $C$ in the equation $C = K a^{t}$ yields $40 = K a^{0}$, or $40 = K$. It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by $190 \%$ of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour. Multiplying the percent increase by the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour yields the number of estimated additional comments the article has on its home page: $\left(40\right) \left(\frac{190}{100}\right)$, or $76$ comments. Thus, the estimated number of comments for the following hour is the sum of the comments from the end of the previous hour and the number of additional comments, which is $40 + 76$, or $116$. This means that when $t = 1$, $C = 116$. Substituting $1$ for $t$, $116$ for $C$, and $40$ for $K$ in the equation $C = K a^{t}$ yields $116 = 40 a^{1}$, or $116 = 40 a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $40$ yields $2.9 = a$. Substituting $40$ for $K$ and $2.9$ for $a$ in the equation $C = K a^{t}$ yields $C = 40 \left(2.9\right)^{t}$.

It follows that the equation $\frac{\left(x^{2} - c^{2}\right) \left(x^{2} - c^{2}\right)}{x^{2} - c^{2}} = 39^{2}$ can be rewritten as $\left(\frac{x^{2} - c^{2}}{x^{2} - c^{2}}\right) \left(x^{2} - c^{2}\right) = 39^{2}$, or $\left(1\right) \left(x^{2} - c^{2}\right) = 39^{2}$, which is equivalent to $x^{2} - c^{2} = 39^{2}$. Adding $c^{2}$ to both sides of this equation yields $x^{2} = c^{2} + 39^{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields two solutions: $x = \sqrt{c^{2} + 39^{2}}$ and $x = - \sqrt{c^{2} + 39^{2}}$.

By the zero product property, if $\left(x + 14\right) \left(t - x\right) = 0$, then $x + 14 = 0$, which gives $x = - 14$, or $\left(t - x\right) = 0$, which gives $x = t$. Therefore, $g \left(x\right) = 0$ when $x = - 14$ and when $x = t$. Since the graph of $y = g \left(x\right)$ passes through the point $\left(24 , 0\right)$, it follows that $g \left(24\right) = 0$, so $t = 24$. Substituting $24$ for $t$ in the equation $g \left(x\right) = \left(x + 14\right) \left(t - x\right)$ yields $g \left(x\right) = \left(x + 14\right) \left(24 - x\right)$.

Since $5 \left(x + 7\right)$ is a common factor of each of the terms on the right-hand side of this equation, it can be rewritten as $0 = 5 \left(x + 7\right) \left(3 \left(x - 17\right) - 1\right)$. This is equivalent to $0 = 5 \left(x + 7\right) \left(3 x - 51 - 1\right)$, or $0 = 5 \left(x + 7\right) \left(3 x - 52\right)$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $5$ yields $0 = \left(x + 7\right) \left(3 x - 52\right)$. Since a product of two factors is equal to $0$ if and only if at least one of the factors is $0$, either $x + 7 = 0$ or $3 x - 52 = 0$. Subtracting $7$ from both sides of the equation $x + 7 = 0$ yields $x = - 7$. Adding $52$ to both sides of the equation $3 x - 52 = 0$ yields $3 x = 52$.

If $k - x$ is a factor of the expression $- x^{2} + \left(\frac{1}{29}\right) n k^{2}$, then the expression can be written as $\left(k - x\right) \left(a x + b\right)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. This expression can be rewritten as $a k x + b k - a x^{2} - b x$, or $- a x^{2} + \left(a k - b\right) x + b k$. Since this expression is equivalent to $- x^{2} + \left(\frac{1}{29}\right) n k^{2}$, it follows that $- a = - 1$, $a k - b = 0$, and $b k = \left(\frac{1}{29}\right) n k^{2}$. Dividing each side of the equation $- a = - 1$ by $- 1$ yields $a = 1$. Substituting $1$ for $a$ in the equation $a k - b = 0$ yields $k - b = 0$. Adding $b$ to each side of this equation yields $k = b$. Substituting $k$ for $b$ in the equation $b k = \left(\frac{1}{29}\right) n k^{2}$ yields $k^{2} = \left(\frac{1}{29}\right) n k^{2}$. Since $k$ is positive, dividing each side of this equation by $k^{2}$ yields $1 = \left(\frac{1}{29}\right) n$. Multiplying each side of this equation by $29$ yields $29 = n$. Alternate approach: The expression $x^{2} - y^{2}$ can be written as $\left(x - y\right) \left(x + y\right)$, which is a difference of two squares.

It’s given that $k - x$ is a factor of $- x^{2} + \left(\frac{1}{29}\right) n k^{2}$, so the factor $\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{29} n}\right) k - x$ is equal to $k - x$. Adding $x$ to both sides of the equation $\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{29} n}\right) k - x = k - x$ yields $\left(\sqrt{\frac{1}{29} n}\right) k = k$. Since $k$ is positive, dividing both sides of this equation by $k$ yields $\sqrt{\frac{1}{29} n} = 1$. Squaring both sides of this equation yields $\frac{1}{29} n = 1$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $29$ yields $n = 29$. Choice A is incorrect. This value of $n$ gives the expression $- x^{2} + \left(\frac{1}{29}\right) \left(- 29\right) k^{2}$, or $- x^{2} - k^{2}$. This expression doesn't have $k - x$ as a factor. Choice B is incorrect.

Multiplying each side of the given equation by $- 16$ yields $64 x^{2} + 112 x = 576$. To complete the square, adding $49$ to each side of this equation yields $64 x^{2} + 112 x + 49 = 576 + 49$, or $\left(8 x + 7\right)^{2} = 625$. Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields two equations: $8 x + 7 = 25$ and $8 x + 7 = - 25$. Subtracting $7$ from each side of the equation $8 x + 7 = 25$ yields $8 x = 18$. Dividing each side of this equation by $8$ yields $x = \frac{18}{8}$, or $x = \frac{9}{4}$. Therefore, $\frac{9}{4}$ is a solution to the given equation. Subtracting $7$ from each side of the equation $8 x + 7 = - 25$ yields $8 x = - 32$. Dividing each side of this equation by $8$ yields $x = - 4$.

Factoring out the common factor of $\left(x + 4\right)$ from these two terms yields the expression $\left(4 x - 9\right) \left(x + 4\right)$. Since this expression is equal to $0$, it follows that either $4 x - 9 = 0$ or $x + 4 = 0$. Adding $9$ to each side of the equation $4 x - 9 = 0$ yields $4 x = 9$.

In this equation, $b$ represents the time, in seconds, at which the softball reaches its maximum height of $c$ meters above the ground. It's given that this softball reaches a maximum height of $51.84$ meters above the ground at $1.8$ seconds; therefore, $b = 1.8$ and $c = 51.84$. Substituting $1.8$ for $b$ and $51.84$ for $c$ in the equation $h = - a \left(t - b\right)^{2} + c$ yields $h = - a \left(t - 1.8\right)^{2} + 51.84$. It's also given that this softball hits the ground at $3.6$ seconds; therefore, $h = 0$ when $t = 3.6$. Substituting $0$ for $h$ and $3.6$ for $t$ in the equation $h = - a \left(t - 1.8\right)^{2} + 51.84$ yields $0 = - a \left(3.6 - 1.8\right)^{2} + 51.84$, which is equivalent to $0 = - a \left(1.8\right)^{2} + 51.84$, or $0 = - 3.24 a + 51.84$. Adding $3.24 a$ to both sides of this equation yields $3.24 a = 51.84$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $3.24$ yields $a = 16$.

Let $x$ represent the side length, in inches, of square P. It follows that the perimeter of square P is $4 x$ inches. It's given that square Q has a perimeter that is $176$ inches greater than the perimeter of square P. Thus, the perimeter of square Q is $176$ inches greater than $4 x$ inches, or $4 x + 176$ inches. Since the perimeter of a square is $4$ times the side length of the square, each side length of Q is $\frac{4 x + 176}{4}$, or $x + 44$ inches.

Let $p$ and $q$ represent the solutions to the given equation. Then, the given equation can be rewritten as $64 \left(x - p\right) \left(x - q\right) = 0$, or $64 x^{2} - 64 \left(p + q\right) + p q = 0$. Since this equation is equivalent to the given equation, it follows that $- \left(16 a + 4 b\right) = - 64 \left(p + q\right)$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $- 64$ yields $\frac{16 a + 4 b}{64} = p + q$, or $\frac{1}{16} \left(4 a + b\right) = p + q$. Therefore, the sum of the solutions to the given equation, $p + q$, is equal to $\frac{1}{16} \left(4 a + b\right)$. Since it's given that the sum of the solutions to the given equation is $k \left(4 a + b\right)$, where $k$ is a constant, it follows that $k = \frac{1}{16}$. Note that 1/16, .0625, 0.062, and 0.063 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer. Alternate approach: The given equation can be rewritten as $64 x^{2} - 4 \left(4 a + b\right) x + a b = 0$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive constants. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $16 x^{2} - \left(4 a + b\right) x + \frac{a b}{4} = 0$. The solutions for a quadratic equation in the form $A x^{2} + B x + C = 0$, where $A$, $B$, and $C$ are constants, can be calculated using the quadratic formula, $x = \frac{- B + \sqrt{B^{2} - 4 A C}}{2 A}$ and $x = \frac{- B - \sqrt{B^{2} - 4 A C}}{2 A}$. It follows that the sum of the solutions to a quadratic equation in the form $A x^{2} + B x + C = 0$ is $\frac{- B + \sqrt{B^{2} - 4 A C}}{2 A} + \frac{- B - \sqrt{B^{2} - 4 A C}}{2 A}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{- B + - B + \sqrt{B^{2} - 4 A C} - \sqrt{B^{2} - 4 A C}}{2 A}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{- 2 B}{2 A}$, or $- \frac{B}{A}$. In the equation $16 x^{2} - \left(4 a + b\right) x + \frac{a b}{4} = 0$, $A = 16$, $B = - \left(4 a + b\right)$, and $C = \frac{a b}{4}$. Substituting $16$ for $A$ and $- \left(4 a + b\right)$ for $B$ in $- \frac{B}{A}$ yields $- \frac{- \left(4 a + b\right)}{16}$, which can be rewritten as $\frac{1}{16} \left(4 a + b\right)$. Thus, the sum of the solutions to the given equation is $\frac{1}{16} \left(4 a + b\right)$. Since it's given that the sum of the solutions to the given equation is $k \left(4 a + b\right)$, where $k$ is a constant, it follows that $k = \frac{1}{16}$."

Squaring both sides of this equation yields $k - x = \left(\right. 58 - x \left.\right)^{2}$, which is equivalent to the given equation if $58 - x > 0$. It follows that if a solution to the equation $k - x = \left(\right. 58 - x \left.\right)^{2}$ satisfies $58 - x > 0$, then it's also a solution to the given equation; if not, it's extraneous. The equation $k - x = \left(\right. 58 - x \left.\right)^{2}$ can be rewritten as $k - x = 3,364 - 116 x + x^{2}$. Adding $x$ to both sides of this equation yields $k = x^{2} - 115 x + 3,364$. Subtracting $k$ from both sides of this equation yields $0 = x^{2} - 115 x + \left(\right. 3,364 - k \left.\right)$. The number of solutions to a quadratic equation in the form $0 = a x^{2} + b x + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, can be determined by the value of the discriminant, $b^{2} - 4 a c$. Substituting $- 115$ for $b$, $1$ for $a$, and $3,364 - k$ for $c$ in $b^{2} - 4 a c$ yields $\left(\right. - 115 \left.\right)^{2} - 4 \left(\right. 1 \left.\right) \left(\right. 3,364 - k \left.\right)$, or $4 k - 231$. The equation $0 = x^{2} - 115 x + \left(\right. 3,364 - k \left.\right)$ has exactly one real solution if the discriminant is equal to zero, or $4 k - 231 = 0$. Subtracting $231$ from both sides of this equation yields $4 k = 231$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $k = 57.75$. Therefore, if $k = 57.75$, then the equation $0 = x^{2} - 115 x + \left(\right. 3,364 - k \left.\right)$ has exactly one real solution. Substituting $57.75$ for $k$ in this equation yields $0 = x^{2} - 115 x + \left(\right. 3,364 - 57.75 \left.\right)$, or $0 = x^{2} - 115 x + 3,306.25$, which is equivalent to $0 = \left(\right. x - 57.5 \left.\right)^{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $0 = x - 57.5$. Adding $57.5$ to both sides of this equation yields $57.5 = x$. To check whether this solution satisfies $58 - x > 0$, the solution, $57.5$, can be substituted for $x$ in $58 - x > 0$, which yields $58 - 57.5 > 0$, or $0.5 > 0$. Since $0.5$ is greater than $0$, it follows that if $k = 57.75$, or $4 k = 231$, then the given equation has exactly one real solution. If $4 k"

The given absolute value equation can be rewritten as two linear equations: $4 x - 4 = 112$ and $- \left(4 x - 4\right) = 112$, or $4 x - 4 = - 112$. Adding $4$ to both sides of the equation $4 x - 4 = 112$ results in $4 x = 116$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ results in $x = 29$. Adding $4$ to both sides of the equation $4 x - 4 = - 112$ results in $4 x = - 108$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ results in $x = - 27$. Therefore, the two values of $x - 1$ are $29 - 1$, or $28$, and $- 27 - 1$, or $- 28$. Thus, the positive value of $x - 1$ is $28$. Alternate approach: The given equation can be rewritten as $\left|4 \left(x - 1\right)\right| = 112$, which is equivalent to $4 \left|x - 1\right| = 112$.

The left-hand side of the equation can be factored by finding two numbers whose sum is 3 and whose product is 2, which gives (x + 2)(x + 1) = 0. Setting each factor equal to 0 yields x + 2 = 0 and x + 1 = 0, and solving for x yields x = –2 or x = –1. These values of x can be substituted for x in the equation y = –x – 1 to find the corresponding y-values: y = –(–2) – 1 = 2 – 1 = 1 and y = –(–1) – 1 = 1 – 1 = 0.

This equation can be rewritten as a quadratic equation in standard form: [Math: x squared, minus 4 x, minus 5, = 0]. One way to solve this quadratic equation is to factor the expression [Math: x squared, minus 4 x, minus 5] by identifying two numbers with a sum of [Math: - 4] and a product of [Math: - 5]. These numbers are [Math: - 5] and 1. So the quadratic equation can be factored as [Math: open parenthesis, x minus 5, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, x + 1, close parenthesis, = 0].

Since the coefficient of the $x^{2}$-term is positive, the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane opens upward and reaches its minimum value at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is the value of $x$ such that $f \left(x\right)$ reaches its minimum. For an equation in the form $f \left(x\right) = a x^{2} + b x + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $- \frac{b}{2 a}$. For the equation $f \left(x\right) = x^{2} + 3 x - 130$, $a = 1$, $b = 3$, and $c = - 130$. It follows that the x-coordinate of the vertex is $- \frac{3}{2 \left(1\right)}$, or $- \frac{3}{2}$. Therefore, $f \left(x\right)$ reaches its minimum when the value of $x$ is $- \frac{3}{2}$. Alternate approach: The value of $x$ for the vertex of a parabola is the x-value of the midpoint between the two x-intercepts of the parabola. Since it’s given that $f \left(x\right) = \left(x - 10\right) \left(x + 13\right)$, it follows that the two x-intercepts of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane occur when $x = 10$ and $x = - 13$, or at the points $\left(10 , 0\right)$ and $\left(- 13 , 0\right)$.

Substituting $2$ for $x$ in the equation $h \left(x\right) = x^{2} - 3$ yields $h \left(2\right) = \left(2\right)^{2} - 3$, or $h \left(2\right) = 1$. Finally, substituting $3$ for $x$ in the equation $h \left(x\right) = x^{2} - 3$ yields $h \left(3\right) = \left(3\right)^{2} - 3$, or $h \left(3\right) = 6$. Therefore, $h \left(x\right)$ is $- 2$ when $x$ is $1$, $h \left(x\right)$ is $1$ when $x$ is $2$, and $h \left(x\right)$ is $6$ when $x$ is $3$.

If the first integer is $11$ greater than twice the second integer, what is the smaller of the two integers?",$7$,$14$,$39$,$78$,B,,"Choice B is correct. Let $x$ be the first integer and let $y$ be the second integer. If the first integer is $11$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x = 2 y + 11$. If the product of the two integers is $546$, then $x y = 546$. Substituting $2 y + 11$ for $x$ in this equation results in $\left(2 y + 11\right) y = 546$. Distributing the $y$ to both terms in the parentheses results in $2 y^{2} + 11 y = 546$. Subtracting $546$ from both sides of this equation results in $2 y^{2} + 11 y - 546 = 0$. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is $2 \left(- 546\right)$, or $- 1,092$, and whose sum is $11$. The two values whose product is $- 1,092$ and whose sum is $11$ are $39$ and $- 28$. Thus, the equation $2 y^{2} + 11 y - 546 = 0$ can be rewritten as $2 y^{2} + 28 y - 39 y - 546 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2 y \left(y - 14\right) + 39 \left(y - 14\right) = 0$, or $\left(2 y + 39\right) \left(y - 14\right) = 0$. By the zero product property, it follows that $2 y + 39 = 0$ and $y - 14 = 0$. Subtracting $39$ from both sides of the equation $2 y + 39 = 0$ yields $2 y = - 39$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $y = - \frac{39}{2}$. Since $y$ is a positive integer, the value of $y$ is not $- \frac{39}{2}$. Adding $14$ to both sides of the equation $y - 14 = 0$ yields $y = 14$. Substituting $14$ for $y$ in the equation $x y = 546$ yields $x \left(14\right) = 546$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $14$ results in $x = 39$. Therefore, the two integers are $14$ and $39$, so the smaller of the two integers is $14$. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect. This is the larger of the two integers.

If $q \left(0\right) = 14$, then $a = 14$. Since the value of $q \left(x\right)$ decreases by $45 \%$ for every increase in the value of $x$ by $1$, $p = 45$. Substituting $14$ for $a$ and $45$ for $p$ in the equation $q \left(x\right) = a \left(1 - \frac{p}{100}\right)^{x}$ yields $q \left(x\right) = 14 \left(1 - \frac{45}{100}\right)^{x}$, which is equivalent to $q \left(x\right) = 14 \left(1 - 0.45\right)^{x}$, or $q \left(x\right) = 14 \left(0.55\right)^{x}$.

It’s given that a line with equation $2 y = 4 . 5$ intersects a parabola with equation $y = - 4 x^{2} + b x$, where $b$ is a positive constant, at exactly one point in the xy-plane. It follows that the system of equations consisting of $2 y = 4 . 5$ and $y = - 4 x^{2} + b x$ has exactly one solution. Dividing both sides of the equation of the line by $2$ yields $y = 2 . 25$. Substituting $2.25$ for $y$ in the equation of the parabola yields $2 . 25 = - 4 x^{2} + b x$.

Since it's given that the account balance, $A \left(t\right)$, in dollars, after $t$ years can be modeled by an exponential function, it follows that function $A$ can be written in the form $A \left(t\right) = N r^{t}$, where $N$ is the initial value of the function and $r$ is a constant related to the growth of the function. It's given that the initial balance of the account is $\$ 36,100.00$, so it follows that the initial value of the function, or $N$, must be $36,100.00$. Substituting $36,100.00$ for $N$ in the equation $A \left(t\right) = N r^{t}$ yields $A \left(t\right) = 36,100.00 r^{t}$. It's given that the account balance after $13$ years, or when $t = 13$, is $\$ 68,071.93$. It follows that $A \left(13\right) = 68,071.93$, or $36,100.00 r^{13} = 68,071.93$. Dividing each side of the equation $36,100.00 r^{13} = 68,071.93$ by $36,100.00$ yields $r^{13} = \frac{68,071.93}{36,100.00}$. Taking the $13$th root of both sides of this equation yields $r = \sqrt[13]{\frac{68,071.93}{36,100.00}}$, or $r$ is approximately equal to $1.05$.

It's also given that the function $f$ is defined by $f \left(x\right) = a x^{2} + b x + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants. It follows that the function $f$ is a quadratic function and, therefore, may be written in factored form as $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - u\right) \left(x - v\right)$, where the value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $0$ when $x$ is either $u$ or $v$. Since the value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $0$ when the value of $x$ is either $7$ or $- 3$, and the value of $f \left(x\right)$ is $0$ when the value of $x$ is either $u$ or $v$, it follows that $u$ and $v$ are equal to $7$ and $- 3$. Substituting $7$ for $u$ and $- 3$ for $v$ in the equation $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - u\right) \left(x - v\right)$ yields $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - 7\right) \left(x - \left(- 3\right)\right)$, or $f \left(x\right) = a \left(x - 7\right) \left(x + 3\right)$.

Since it's given that $f \left(x\right) = a x^{2} + b x + c$, it follows that $b = - 4 a$. Adding $a$ to each side of this equation yields $a + b = - 3 a$. Since $a + b = - 3 a$, if $a$ is an integer, the value of $a + b$ must be a multiple of $3$. If $a$ is an integer greater than $1$, it follows that $a \geq 2$.

Let $x$ represent the first integer and $y$ represent the second integer. If the first integer is $5$ greater than twice the second integer, then $x = 2 y + 5$. It's given that the product of the two integers is $462$; therefore $x y = 462$. Substituting $2 y + 5$ for $x$ in this equation yields $\left(\right. 2 y + 5 \left.\right) \left(\right. y \left.\right) = 462$, which can be written as $2 y^{2} + 5 y = 462$. Subtracting $462$ from each side of this equation yields $2 y^{2} + 5 y - 462 = 0$. The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is $2 \left(\right. - 462 \left.\right)$, or $- 924$, and whose sum is $5$. The two values whose product is $- 924$ and whose sum is $5$ are $33$ and $- 28$. Thus, the equation $2 y^{2} + 5 y - 462 = 0$ can be rewritten as $2 y^{2} - 28 y + 33 y - 462 = 0$, which is equivalent to $2 y \left(\right. y - 14 \left.\right) + 33 \left(\right. y - 14 \left.\right) = 0$, or $\left(\right. 2 y + 33 \left.\right) \left(\right. y - 14 \left.\right) = 0$. By the zero product property, it follows that $2 y + 33 = 0$ or $y - 14 = 0$. Subtracting $33$ from both sides of the equation $2 y + 33 = 0$ yields $2 y = - 33$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$ yields $y = - \frac{33}{2}$. Since $y$ is a positive integer, the value of $y$ isn't $- \frac{33}{2}$. Adding $14$ to both sides of the equation $y - 14 = 0$ yields $y = 14$. Substituting $14$ for $y$ in the equation $x y = 462$ yields $x \left(\right. 14 \left.\right) = 462$.

Since the value of $f \left(5\right)$ is the value of $f \left(x\right)$ when $x = 5$, it follows that “$f \left(5\right)$ is approximately equal to $243$” means that $f \left(x\right)$ is approximately equal to $243$ when $x = 5$. In the given context, this means that the value of the bank account is estimated to be approximately $243$ dollars $5$ years after $19 57$.

The given equation $8 x + y = - 11$ can be rewritten to isolate $y$ by subtracting $8 x$ from both sides of the equation, which gives $y = - 8 x - 11$. The given equation $2 x^{2} = y + 341$ can be rewritten to isolate $y$ by subtracting $341$ from both sides of the equation, which gives $2 x^{2} - 341 = y$.

According to the first equation in the given system, the value of $y$ is $- 1.5$. Substituting $- 1.5$ for $y$ in the second equation in the given system yields $- 1.5 = x^{2} + 8 x + a$. Adding $1.5$ to both sides of this equation yields $0 = x^{2} + 8 x + a + 1.5$. If the given system has exactly one distinct real solution, it follows that $0 = x^{2} + 8 x + a + 1.5$ has exactly one distinct real solution. A quadratic equation in the form $0 = p x^{2} + q x + r$, where $p$, $q$, and $r$ are constants, has exactly one distinct real solution if and only if the discriminant, $q^{2} - 4 p r$, is equal to $0$. The equation $0 = x^{2} + 8 x + a + 1.5$ is in this form, where $p = 1$, $q = 8$, and $r = a + 1.5$. Therefore, the discriminant of the equation $0 = x^{2} + 8 x + a + 1.5$ is $\left(8\right)^{2} - 4 \left(1\right) \left(a + 1.5\right)$, or $58 - 4 a$. Setting the discriminant equal to $0$ to solve for $a$ yields $58 - 4 a = 0$. Adding $4 a$ to both sides of this equation yields $58 = 4 a$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $4$ yields $\frac{58}{4} = a$, or $\frac{29}{2} = a$.

Substituting $18$ for $y$ in the second equation yields $18 = - 3 \left(x - 18\right)^{2} + 15$. Subtracting $15$ from each side of this equation yields $3 = - 3 \left(x - 18\right)^{2}$. Dividing each side of this equation by $- 3$ yields $- 1 = \left(x - 18\right)^{2}$. Since the square of a real number is at least $0$, this equation can't have any real solutions.

Functions $f$ and $g$ are both exponential functions with a base of $0.40$. Since $0.40$ is less than $1$, functions $f$ and $g$ are both decreasing exponential functions. This means that $f \left(x\right)$ and $g \left(x\right)$ decrease as $x$ increases. Since $f \left(x\right)$ and $g \left(x\right)$ decrease as $x$ increases, the maximum value of each function occurs at the least value of $x$ for which the function is defined. It's given that functions $f$ and $g$ are defined for $x \geq 0$. Therefore, the maximum value of each function occurs at $x = 0$. Substituting $0$ for $x$ in the equation defining $f$ yields $f \left(0\right) = 33 \left(0.4\right)^{0 + 3}$, which is equivalent to $f \left(0\right) = 33 \left(0.4\right)^{3}$, or $f \left(0\right) = 2.112$. Therefore, the maximum value of $f$ is $2.112$. Since the equation $f \left(x\right) = 33 \left(0.4\right)^{x + 3}$ doesn't display the value $2.112$, the equation defining $f$ doesn't display the maximum value of $f$.

Adding $2 x^{2}$ and $- 9 x$ to both sides of this equation yields $2 x^{2} - 9 x + \frac{c}{2} = 0$.

The y-intercept of a graph in the ty-plane is the point where $t = 0$. For the given function $f$, the y-intercept of the graph of $y = f \left(t\right)$ in the ty-plane can be found by substituting $0$ for $t$ in the equation $y = 8,000 \left(0 . 65\right)^{t}$, which gives $y = 8,000 \left(0 . 65\right)^{0}$. This is equivalent to $y = 8,000 \left(1\right)$, or $y = 8,000$. Therefore, the y-intercept of the graph of $y = f \left(t\right)$ is $\left(0 , 8,000\right)$. It’s given that the function $f$ models the number of coupons a company sent to their customers at the end of each year. Therefore, $f \left(t\right)$ represents the estimated number of coupons the company sent to their customers at the end of each year. It's also given that $t$ represents the number of years since the end of $1998$. Therefore, $t = 0$ represents $0$ years since the end of $1998$, or the end of $1998$.

The graph of the function f in the xy-plane has x-intercepts at the points [Math: with coordinates x , y], where [Math: y = f of x, which = 0].

By the zero product property, if [Math: 0 =, open parenthesis, x + 4, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, x minus 1, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, 2 x minus 3, close parenthesis], then [Math: x + 4, = 0], [Math: x minus 1, = 0], or [Math: 2 x minus 3, = 0]. Solving each of these linear equations for x, it follows that [Math: x = - 4], [Math: x = 1], and [Math: x = three halves], respectively. This means that the graph of the function f in the xy-plane has three x-intercepts: [Math: the . with coordinates - 4 , 0], [Math: the . with coordinates 1 , 0], and [Math: the . with coordinates three halves , 0]. Therefore, [Math: the . with coordinates - two thirds , 0] isn’t an x-intercept of the graph of the function f.Alternate approach: Substitution may be used. Since by definition an x-intercept of any graph is a point in the form [Math: k , 0] where k is a constant, and since all points in the options are in this form, it need only be checked whether the points in the options lie on the graph of the function f. Substituting [Math: - two thirds] for x and 0 for [Math: f of x] in the given equation yields [Math: 0 =, open parenthesis, - two thirds + 4, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, - two thirds minus 1, close parenthesis, times, open parenthesis, 2 times - two thirds, minus 3, close parenthesis], or [Math: 0 =, the fraction 650 over 27]. Therefore, the point [Math: with coordinates - two thirds , 0] doesn’t lie on the graph of the function f and can’t be an x-intercept of the graph.Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because each of these points is an x-intercept of the graph of the function f in the xy-plane. By definition, an x-intercept is a point on the graph of the form [Math: k , 0], where k is a constant.

For what value of $x$ does $f \left(x\right)$ reach its minimum?,$- 266$,$- 19$,$- \frac{33}{2}$,$- \frac{5}{2}$,D,,"Choice D is correct. It's given that $f \left(x\right) = \left(x - 14\right) \left(x + 19\right)$, which can be rewritten as $f \left(x\right) = x^{2} + 5 x - 266$. Since the coefficient of the $x^{2}$-term is positive, the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane opens upward and reaches its minimum value at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is the value of $x$ such that $f \left(x\right)$ reaches its minimum. For an equation in the form $f \left(x\right) = a x^{2} + b x + c$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants, the x-coordinate of the vertex is $- \frac{b}{2 a}$. For the equation $f \left(x\right) = x^{2} + 5 x - 266$, $a = 1$, $b = 5$, and $c = - 266$. It follows that the x-coordinate of the vertex is $- \frac{5}{2 \left(1\right)}$, or $- \frac{5}{2}$. Therefore, $f \left(x\right)$ reaches its minimum when the value of $x$ is $- \frac{5}{2}$. Alternate approach: The value of $x$ for the vertex of a parabola is the x-value of the midpoint between the two x-intercepts of the parabola. Since it’s given that $f \left(x\right) = \left(x - 14\right) \left(x + 19\right)$, it follows that the two x-intercepts of the graph of $y = f \left(x\right)$ in the xy-plane occur when $x = 14$ and $x = - 19$, or at the points $\left(14 , 0\right)$ and $\left(- 19 , 0\right)$. The midpoint between two points, $\left(x_{1} , y_{1}\right)$ and $\left(x_{2} , y_{2}\right)$, is $\left(\frac{x_{1} + x_{2}}{2} , \frac{y_{1} + y_{2}}{2}\right)$. Therefore, the midpoint between $\left(14 , 0\right)$ and $\left(- 19 , 0\right)$ is $\left(\frac{14 + \left(- 19\right)}{2} , \frac{0 + 0}{2}\right)$, or $\left(- \frac{5}{2} , 0\right)$.

Therefore, the expression $\frac{42 a}{k} + 42 a k$ can be written as $\frac{42 a}{k} + \frac{42 a k^{2}}{k}$ which is equivalent to $\frac{42 a + 42 a k^{2}}{k}$. Since each term in the numerator of this expression has a factor of $42 a$, the expression $\frac{42 a + 42 a k^{2}}{k}$ can be rewritten as $\frac{42 a \left(1\right) + 42 a \left(k^{2}\right)}{k}$, or $\frac{42 a \left(1 + k^{2}\right)}{k}$, which is equivalent to $\frac{ 42 a \left(\right. k^{2} + 1 \left.\right)}{k}$.

Substituting $1$ for $x$ in the given function yields $q \left(1\right) = 32 \left(2\right)^{1}$, which is equivalent to $q \left(1\right) = 32 \left(2\right)$, or $q \left(1\right) = 64$.

For what value of $x$ does $g \left(x\right)$ reach its minimum?,$- 13$,$- 8$,$- 5$,$- 3$,A,,"Choice A is correct. It's given that $g \left(x\right) = f \left(x + 5\right)$. Since $f \left(x\right) = 4 x^{2} + 64 x + 262$, it follows that $f \left(x + 5\right) = 4 \left(x + 5\right)^{2} + 64 \left(x + 5\right) + 262$. Expanding the quantity $\left(x + 5\right)^{2}$ in this equation yields $f \left(x + 5\right) = 4 \left(x^{2} + 10 x + 25\right) + 64 \left(x + 5\right) + 262$. Distributing the $4$ and the $64$ yields $f \left(x + 5\right) = 4 x^{2} + 40 x + 100 + 64 x + 320 + 262$. Combining like terms yields $f \left(x + 5\right) = 4 x^{2} + 104 x + 682$. Therefore, $g \left(x\right) = 4 x^{2} + 104 x + 682$. For a quadratic function defined by an equation of the form $g \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$, where $a$, $h$, and $k$ are constants and $a$ is positive, $g \left(x\right)$ reaches its minimum, $k$, when the value of $x$ is $h$. The equation $g \left(x\right) = 4 x^{2} + 104 x + 682$ can be rewritten in this form by completing the square. This equation is equivalent to $g \left(x\right) = 4 \left(x^{2} + 26\right) + 682$, or $g \left(x\right) = 4 \left(x^{2} + 26 x + 169 - 169\right) + 682$. This equation can be rewritten as $g \left(x\right) = 4 \left(\left(x + 13\right)^{2} - 169\right) + 682$, or $g \left(x\right) = 4 \left(x + 13\right)^{2} - 4 \left(169\right) + 682$, which is equivalent to $g \left(x\right) = 4 \left(x + 13\right)^{2} + 6$. This equation is in the form $g \left(x\right) = a \left(x - h\right)^{2} + k$, where $a = 4$, $h = - 13$, and $k = 6$. Therefore, $g \left(x\right)$ reaches its minimum when the value of $x$ is $- 13$. Choice B is incorrect. This is the value of $x$ for which $f \left(x\right)$, rather than $g \left(x\right)$, reaches its minimum. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect. This is the value of $x$ for which $f \left(x - 5\right)$, rather than $f \left(x + 5\right)$, reaches its minimum."

Multiplying both sides of the given equation by $x + 6$ results in $55 = x \left(x + 6\right)$. Applying the distributive property of multiplication to the right-hand side of this equation results in $55 = x^{2} + 6 x$. Subtracting $55$ from both sides of this equation results in $0 = x^{2} + 6 x - 55$. The right-hand side of this equation can be rewritten by factoring. The two values that multiply to $- 55$ and add to $6$ are $11$ and $- 5$. It follows that the equation $0 = x^{2} + 6 x - 55$ can be rewritten as $0 = \left(x + 11\right) \left(x - 5\right)$. Setting each factor equal to $0$ yields two equations: $x + 11 = 0$ and $x - 5 = 0$. Subtracting $11$ from both sides of the equation $x + 11 = 0$ results in $x = - 11$. Adding $5$ to both sides of the equation $x - 5 = 0$ results in $x = 5$. Therefore, the positive solution to the given equation is $5$."

This can be represented by the equation $\frac{y}{50} = 65$, where $y$ represents the sum of the heights of the objects, in meters, in data set B. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $50$ yields $y = 50 \left(65\right)$, or $y = 3,250$ meters. Therefore, the sum of the heights of the objects in data set B is $3,250$ meters. Since it’s given that data set C consists of the heights of the $125$ objects from data sets A and B, it follows that the mean of data set C is the sum of the heights of the objects, in meters, in data sets A and B divided by the number of objects represented in data sets A and B, or $\frac{1,875 + 3,250}{125}$, which is equivalent to $41$ meters. Therefore, the mean, in meters, of data set C is $41$."

Dividing both sides of this equation by $0.80$ yields $x = 450$. Substituting $450$ for $x$ in the expression $0.20 x$ yields $0.20 \left(\right. 450 \left.\right)$, or $90$. Therefore, $90$ marbles were removed from the group. Choice A is incorrect. This is $20 \%$ of the remaining number of marbles. Choice C is incorrect. This is the original number of marbles, not the number of marbles that were removed. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

It’s given that in Nigeria on September 30, 2015, the probability of selecting an MTN subscriber from all Internet subscribers is 0.43, that there were p million, or [Math: p of 1,000,000], MTN subscribers, and that there were 97 million, or 97,000,000, Internet subscribers. The probability of selecting an MTN subscriber from all Internet subscribers can be found by dividing the number of MTN subscribers by the total number of Internet subscribers. Therefore, the equation [Math: the fraction with numerator p of 1,000,000, and denominator 97,000,000, = 0 . 4 3] can be used to solve for p. Dividing 1,000,000 from the numerator and denominator of the expression on the left-hand side yields [Math: the fraction p over 97, = 0 . 4 3]. Multiplying both sides of this equation by 97 yields [Math: p =, 0 . 4 3 times 97, which = 41 . 7 1], which, to the nearest integer, is 42."

The same object’s weight on Jupiter is approximately [Math: twenty three tenths] of its weight on Earth; therefore, the object weighs approximately [Math: twenty three tenths times 100, = 230] pounds on Jupiter. The difference between the object’s weight on Jupiter and the object’s weight on Venus is approximately [Math: 230 minus 90, = 140] pounds. Therefore, an object that weighs 100 pounds on Earth weighs 140 more pounds on Jupiter than it weighs on Venus.Choice A is incorrect because it is the weight, in pounds, of the object on Venus. Choice B is incorrect because it is the weight, in pounds, of an object on Earth if it weighs 100 pounds on Venus.

What is the mean, in meters, of data set C?",,,,,44,44,"The correct answer is $44$. The mean of a data set is computed by dividing the sum of the values in the data set by the number of values in the data set. It's given that data set A consists of the heights of $75$ buildings and has a mean of $32$ meters. This can be represented by the equation $\frac{x}{75} = 32$, where $x$ represents the sum of the heights of the buildings, in meters, in data set A. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $75$ yields $x = 75 \left(32\right)$, or $x = 2,400$ meters. Therefore, the sum of the heights of the buildings in data set A is $2,400$ meters. It's also given that data set B consists of the heights of $50$ buildings and has a mean of $62$ meters. This can be represented by the equation $\frac{y}{50} = 62$, where $y$ represents the sum of the heights of the buildings, in meters, in data set B. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $50$ yields $y = 50 \left(62\right)$, or $y = 3,100$ meters. Therefore, the sum of the heights of the buildings in data set B is $3,100$ meters. Since it's given that data set C consists of the heights of the $125$ buildings from data sets A and B, it follows that the mean of data set C is the sum of the heights of the buildings, in meters, in data sets A and B divided by the number of buildings represented in data sets A and B, or $\frac{2,400 + 3,100}{125}$, which is equivalent to $44$ meters.

This proportion can be rewritten as $10 \mathcal{l} = 35 w$, or $\mathcal{l} = 3.5 w$. If the width of the rectangular region increases by $7$, then the length will increase by some number $x$ in order to maintain this ratio. The value of $x$ can be found by replacing $\mathcal{l}$ with $\mathcal{l} + x$ and $w$ with $w + 7$ in the equation, which gives $\mathcal{l} + x = 3.5 \left(w + 7\right)$. This equation can be rewritten using the distributive property as $\mathcal{l} + x = 3.5 w + 24.5$. Since $\mathcal{l} = 3.5 w$, the right-hand side of this equation can be rewritten by substituting $\mathcal{l}$ for $3.5 w$, which gives $\mathcal{l} + x = \mathcal{l} + 24.5$, or $x = 24.5$.

It’s given that the side length of the larger square is $3$ times the side length of the smaller square. This means that the area of the larger square is $3^{2}$, or $9$, times the area of the smaller square. If the area of the smaller square is represented by $x$, then the area of the larger square can be represented by $9 x$. Therefore, the flat surface of the two adjacent squares has a total area of $x + 9 x$, or $10 x$. It’s given that an electric field with strength $29.00$ volts per meter passes uniformly through this surface and the total electric flux of the electric field through this surface is $4,640 \text{volts} \cdot \text{meters}$. Since it's given that the electric flux is the product of the electric field’s strength and the area of the surface, the equation $29.00 \left(10 x\right) = 4,640$, or $290 x = 4,640$, can be used to represent this situation.

To the nearest hundredth of a meter, what is the length of one edge of this sample?",$0.98$,$0.99$,$1.01$,$1.02$,B,,"Choice B is correct. It’s given that the density of a certain type of wood is $353$ kilograms per cubic meter $\left(\text{kg}/\text{m}^{3}\right)$, and a sample of this type of wood has a mass of $345 \text{kg}$. Let $x$ represent the volume, in $\text{m}^{3}$, of the sample. It follows that the relationship between the density, mass, and volume of this sample can be writtenas $\frac{353 \text{kg}}{1 \text{m}^{3}} = \frac{345 \text{kg}}{x \text{m}^{3}}$, or $353 = \frac{345}{x}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $x$ yields $353 x = 345$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $353$ yields $x = \frac{345}{353}$. Therefore, the volume of this sample is $\frac{345}{353} \text{m}^{3}$. Since it’s given that the sample of this type of wood is a cube, it follows that the length of one edge of this sample can be found using the volume formula for a cube, $V = s^{3}$, where $V$ represents the volume, in $\text{m}^{3}$, and $s$ represents the length, in m, of one edge of the cube. Substituting $\frac{345}{353}$for $V$ in this formula yields $\frac{345}{353} = s^{3}$. Taking the cube root of both sides of this equation yields $\sqrt[3]{\frac{345}{353}} = s$, or $s \approx 0 . 99$.

It’s given that the estimate for the proportion of the population that has the characteristic is $0.49$ with an associated margin of error of $0.04$. Subtracting the margin of error from the estimate and adding the margin of error to the estimate gives an interval of plausible values for the true proportion of the population that has the characteristic.

Let $\mathcal{l}$ represent the length, in inches, of the original poster, and let $w$ represent the width, in inches, of the original poster. Since the area of a rectangle is equal to its length times its width, it follows that $360 = \mathcal{l} w$. It's also given that a copy of the poster is made in which the length and width of the original poster are each increased by $20 \%$. It follows that the length of the copy is the length of the original poster plus $20 \%$ of the length of the original poster, which is equivalent to $\mathcal{l} + \frac{20}{100} \mathcal{l}$ inches.

Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields $\left(1 + 1 + \sqrt{2}\right) \mathcal{l} = 94 + 94 \sqrt{2}$, or $\left(2 + \sqrt{2}\right) \mathcal{l} = 94 + 94 \sqrt{2}$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2 + \sqrt{2}$ yields $\mathcal{l} = \frac{94 + 94 \sqrt{2}}{2 + \sqrt{2}}$. Rationalizing the denominator of the right-hand side of this equation by multiplying the right-hand side of the equation by $\frac{2 - \sqrt{2}}{2 - \sqrt{2}}$ yields $\mathcal{l} = \frac{\left(94 + 94 \sqrt{2}\right) \left(2 - \sqrt{2}\right)}{\left(2 + \sqrt{2}\right) \left(2 - \sqrt{2}\right)}$.

Since [Math: 180 minus 120, = 60], the sum of the measures of [Math: angle Q M R] and [Math: angle N R M] is [Math: 60 degrees]. It is given that [Math: the length of side M P = the length of side P R], so it follows that triangle MPR is isosceles. Therefore[Math: angle Q M R] and [Math: angle N R M] must be congruent. Since the sum of the measure of these two angles is [Math: 60 degrees], it follows that the measure of each angle is [Math: 30 degrees].An alternate approach would be to use the exterior angle theorem, noting that the measure of [Math: angle Q P R] is equal to the sum of the measures of [Math: angle Q M R] and [Math: angle N R M]. Since both angles are equal, each of them has a measure of [Math: 30 degrees]."

Substituting $x$ for $a$, $x$ for $b$, and $58$ for $c$ in this equation yields $x^{2} + x^{2} = 58^{2}$, or $2 x^{2} = 58^{2}$. Dividing each side of this equation by $2$ yields $x^{2} = \frac{58^{2}}{2}$, or $x^{2} = \frac{2 \cdot 58^{2}}{4}$.

The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the $60 \circ$ angle in each 30-60-90 right triangle.

What is the length of line segment $D E$?",,,,,54,54,"The correct answer is $54$. It’s given that in triangle $A B C$, point $D$ on side $A B$ is connected by a line segment with point $E$ on side $A C$ such that line segment $D E$ is parallel to side $B C$. It follows that parallel segments $D E$ and $B C$ are intersected by sides $A B$ and $A C$. If two parallel segments are intersected by a third segment, corresponding angles are congruent. Thus, corresponding angles $C$ and $A E D$ are congruent and corresponding angles $B$ and $A D E$ are congruent. Since triangle $A D E$ has two angles that are each congruent to an angle in triangle $A B C$, triangle $A D E$ is similar to triangle $A B C$ by the angle-angle similarity postulate, where side $D E$ corresponds to side $B C$, and side $A E$ corresponds to side $A C$. Since the lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional, it follows that $\frac{D E}{B C} = \frac{A E}{A C}$. Since point $E$ lies on side $A C$, $A E + C E = A C$. It's given that $C E = 2 A E$. Substituting $2 A E$ for $C E$ in the equation $A E + C E = A C$ yields $A E + 2 A E = A C$, or $3 A E = A C$. It’s given that $B C = 162$. Substituting $162$ for $B C$ and $3 A E$ for $A C$ in the equation $\frac{D E}{B C} = \frac{A E}{A C}$ yields $\frac{D E}{162} = \frac{A E}{3 A E}$, or $\frac{D E}{162} = \frac{1}{3}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $162$ yields $D E = 54$. Thus, the length of line segment $D E$ is $54$."

The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle, where the shorter side and the longer side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. It's given that the length of the rectangle's diagonal is $3 \sqrt{17}$ and the length of the rectangle's shorter side is $3$. Thus, the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the diagonal is $3 \sqrt{17}$ and the length of one of the legs is $3$. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$. Substituting $3 \sqrt{17}$ for $c$ and $3$ for $b$ in this equation yields $a^{2} + \left(3\right)^{2} = \left(3 \sqrt{17}\right)^{2}$, or $a^{2} + 9 = 153$. Subtracting $9$ from both sides of this equation yields $a^{2} = 144$. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields $a = \pm \sqrt{144}$, or $a = \pm 12$.

If the two prisms are glued together along a square base, the resulting prism has a surface area equal to twice the surface area of one of the prisms, minus the area of the two square bases that are being glued together, which yields $2 K - 2 x^{2} \text{cm}^{2}$ . It’s given that this resulting surface area is equal to $\frac{92}{47} K \text{cm}^{2}$, so $2 K - 2 x^{2} = \frac{92}{47} K$. Subtracting $\frac{92}{47} K$ from both sides of this equation yields $2 K - \frac{92}{47} K - 2 x^{2} = 0$. This equation can be rewritten by multiplying $2 K$ on the left-hand side by $\frac{47}{47}$, which yields $\frac{94}{47} K - \frac{92}{47} K - 2 x^{2} = 0$, or $\frac{2}{47} K - 2 x^{2} = 0$. Adding $2 x^{2}$ to both sides of this equation yields $\frac{2}{47} K = 2 x^{2}$. Multiplying both sides of this equation by $\frac{47}{2}$ yields $K = 47 x^{2}$. The surface area $K$, in $\text{cm}^{2}$, of each rectangular prism is equivalent to the sum of the areas of the two square bases and the areas of the four lateral faces. Since the height of each rectangular prism is $90 \text{cm}$ and the side length of each square base is $x \text{cm}$, it follows that the area of each square base is $x^{2} \text{cm}^{2}$ and the area of each lateral face is $90 x \text{cm}^{2}$.

Substituting this expression for $K$ in the equation $K = 47 x^{2}$ yields $2 x^{2} + 360 x = 47 x^{2}$. Subtracting $2 x^{2}$ and $360 x$ from both sides of this equation yields $0 = 45 x^{2} - 360 x$. Factoring $x$ from the right-hand side of this equation yields $0 = x \left(45 x - 360\right)$. Applying the zero product property, it follows that $x = 0$ and $45 x - 360 = 0$. Adding $360$ to both sides of the equation $45 x - 360 = 0$ yields $45 x = 360$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $45$ yields $x = 8$. Since a side length of a rectangular prism can’t be $0$, the length of each square base is $8$ $\text{cm}$.

Extending segment $B C$ at point $C$ and extending segment $D E$ at point $D$ until the two segments intersect results in a transversal that intersects two parallel line segments. One of these intersection points is point $B$, and let the other intersection point be point $X$. Since segment $A B$ is parallel to segment $D E$, alternate interior angles are congruent. Angle $C X D$ and the exterior angle formed by extending segment $A B$ at point $B$ are alternate interior angles. Therefore, the measure of angle $C X D$ is $41$ degrees.

By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length $c$ and legs with lengths $a$ and $b$, then $a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$. Substituting $s$ for $a$ and $2 s$ for $c$ in this equation yields $s^{2} + b^{2} = \left(2 s\right)^{2}$, or $s^{2} + b^{2} = 4 s^{2}$. Subtracting $s^{2}$ from both sides of this equation yields $b^{2} = 3 s^{2}$. Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields$ b = s \sqrt{3}$.

Therefore, the value of $\frac{B C}{B D}$ is $\frac{38}{15}$. Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of $\frac{B D}{B C}$. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."

What is the area, $\text{in} \text{cm}^{2}$, of the square?",$110$,$220$,"$3,025$","$12,100$",C,,"Choice C is correct. The area $A$, $\text{in} \text{square} \text{centimeters} \left(\right. \text{cm}^{2} \left.\right)$, of a square with side length $s$, $\text{in} \text{cm}$, is given by the formula $A = s^{2}$. It’s given that the square has a side length of $55 \text{cm}$. Substituting $55$ for $s$ in the formula $A = s^{2}$ yields $A = 55^{2}$, or $A = 3,025$. Therefore, the area, $\text{in} \text{cm}^{2}$, of the square is $3,025$. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect. This is the perimeter, $\text{in} \text{cm}$, of the square, not its area, $\text{in} \text{cm}^{2}$. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors."
Math,Geometry and Trigonometry,Area and volume,Hard,"A cube has a volume of $474,552$ cubic units. What is the surface area, in square units, of the cube?",,,,,36504,36504,"The correct answer is $36,504$. The volume of a cube can be found using the formula $V = s^{3}$, where $s$ represents the edge length of a cube. It’s given that this cube has a volume of $474,552$ cubic units. Substituting $474,552$ for $V$ in $V = s^{3}$ yields $474,552 = s^{3}$. Taking the cube root of both sides of this equation yields $78 = s$. Thus, the edge length of the cube is $78$ units. Since each face of a cube is a square, it follows that each face has an edge length of $78$ units. The area of a square can be found using the formula $A = s^{2}$. Substituting $78$ for $s$ in this formula yields $A = 78^{2}$, or $A = 6,084$. Therefore, the area of one face of this cube is $6,084$ square units. Since a cube has $6$ faces, the surface area, in square units, of this cube is $6 \left(6,084\right)$, or $36,504$."
