Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,Maria has saved $\$150$. Her goal is to save at least $\$500$ for a new laptop. What is the minimum amount of money she still needs to save?,$\$150$,$\$350$,$\$500$,$\$650$,B,,Let $x$ be the amount of money Maria still needs to save.,The total amount saved will be the sum of what she already has ($\$150$) and the additional amount she saves ($x$). This can be written as $150 + x$.,"Her goal is to save 'at least' $\$500$. This means the total amount saved must be greater than or equal to $\$500$. So, we can write the inequality: $150 + x \geq 500$.","To find the minimum amount she needs to save, we solve for $x$ by subtracting 150 from both sides of the inequality: $x \geq 500 - 150$.",This simplifies to $x \geq 350$.,"Therefore, the minimum amount Maria still needs to save is $\$350$."
Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,"An elevator has a maximum weight capacity of $2,000$ pounds. If there are already people in the elevator who weigh a total of $1,250$ pounds, what is the maximum additional weight the elevator can hold?",$750$ pounds,"$1,250$ pounds","$2,000$ pounds","$3,250$ pounds",A,,Let $w$ be the additional weight that can be added to the elevator.,"The total weight in the elevator is the sum of the current weight ($1,250$ pounds) and the additional weight ($w$). This is $1,250 + w$.","The elevator has a 'maximum' capacity of $2,000$ pounds. This means the total weight must be less than or equal to $2,000$. We can write the inequality: $1,250 + w \leq 2,000$.","To find the maximum additional weight, we solve for $w$ by subtracting 1,250 from both sides: $w \leq 2,000 - 1,250$.",This simplifies to $w \leq 750$.,"Therefore, the maximum additional weight the elevator can hold is $750$ pounds."
Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,"A truck driver needs to cover a distance of at least 450 miles in a day. He travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. Which inequality can be used to find the number of hours, $h$, he must drive to meet his goal?",$60h \leq 450$,$60h \geq 450$,$\frac{h}{60} \geq 450$,$\frac{h}{60} \leq 450$,B,,The distance traveled is calculated by multiplying the speed by the time. The speed is 60 miles per hour and the time is $h$ hours.,The expression for the total distance traveled is $60h$.,The driver needs to cover a distance of 'at least' 450 miles. This means the distance traveled must be greater than or equal to 450.,"Combining the expression for distance and the requirement, we get the inequality $60h \geq 450$.",,
Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,"Which of the following ordered pairs $(x, y)$ is a solution to the inequality $y > 2x - 1$?","$(2, 3)$","$(0, -2)$","$(3, 6)$","$(-1, -4)$",C,,"To check if an ordered pair is a solution, substitute the $x$ and $y$ values into the inequality $y > 2x - 1$ and see if the resulting statement is true.","Test option A: $(2, 3)$. Substitute $x=2$ and $y=3$. Is $3 > 2(2) - 1$? This simplifies to $3 > 4 - 1$, or $3 > 3$. This is false.","Test option B: $(0, -2)$. Substitute $x=0$ and $y=-2$. Is $-2 > 2(0) - 1$? This simplifies to $-2 > 0 - 1$, or $-2 > -1$. This is false.","Test option C: $(3, 6)$. Substitute $x=3$ and $y=6$. Is $6 > 2(3) - 1$? This simplifies to $6 > 6 - 1$, or $6 > 5$. This is true.","Test option D: $(-1, -4)$. Substitute $x=-1$ and $y=-4$. Is $-4 > 2(-1) - 1$? This simplifies to $-4 > -2 - 1$, or $-4 > -3$. This is false.","The only ordered pair that makes the inequality true is $(3, 6)$."
Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,"To be considered a 'healthy' weight, a certain breed of dog should weigh between 25 and 35 pounds, inclusive. Which of the following weights is considered healthy for this breed?",$24.5$ pounds,$30$ pounds,$35.5$ pounds,$20$ pounds,B,,"The problem states the healthy weight $w$ is 'between 25 and 35 pounds, inclusive'.","The word 'inclusive' means that the endpoints, 25 and 35, are included in the range.",This can be written as the compound inequality $25 \leq w \leq 35$.,We need to find which of the given options falls within this range.,$24.5$ is less than 25. $35.5$ is greater than 35. $20$ is less than 25. $30$ is greater than or equal to 25 and less than or equal to 35.,"Therefore, $30$ pounds is the only weight in the healthy range."
Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,A student earns $\$12$ per hour for tutoring and wants to earn more than $\$180$ to buy a new phone. What is the minimum number of whole hours the student must work to afford the phone?,14,15,16,18,C,,Let $h$ be the number of hours the student works.,The total earnings are calculated by multiplying the hourly wage ($\$12$) by the number of hours worked ($h$). The expression for earnings is $12h$.,The student wants to earn 'more than' $\$180$. This means the earnings must be strictly greater than 180. The inequality is $12h > 180$.,"To solve for $h$, divide both sides of the inequality by 12: $h > \frac{180}{12}$.",This simplifies to $h > 15$.,"Since the student must work a whole number of hours and the number of hours must be greater than 15, the minimum number of whole hours is 16."
Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,"Leticia is buying pizza and soda for a party. Each pizza costs $\$10$ and each bottle of soda costs $\$2$. She can spend no more than $\$50$. If $p$ represents the number of pizzas and $s$ represents the number of sodas, which inequality represents this situation?",$10p + 2s \geq 50$,$10p + 2s \leq 50$,$2p + 10s \leq 50$,$12(p+s) \leq 50$,B,,"First, determine the cost for the pizzas. If each pizza is $\$10$ and she buys $p$ pizzas, the total cost for pizzas is $10p$.","Next, determine the cost for the sodas. If each soda is $\$2$ and she buys $s$ sodas, the total cost for sodas is $2s$.",The total amount spent is the sum of the cost of pizzas and the cost of sodas: $10p + 2s$.,The problem states she can spend 'no more than' $\$50$. This means the total cost must be less than or equal to 50.,Combining these parts gives the inequality $10p + 2s \leq 50$.,
Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,A recipe for bread says to bake it for a duration between 45 and 55 minutes. Let $t$ be the baking time in minutes. Which inequality represents the correct baking time?,$t < 45$,$t > 55$,$45 < t < 55$,$t = 50$,C,,"The problem states that the baking time, $t$, is 'between' 45 and 55 minutes.",This implies that the time $t$ must be greater than 45 minutes.,It also implies that the time $t$ must be less than 55 minutes.,These two conditions can be combined into a single compound inequality: $45 < t < 55$.,This inequality correctly represents the situation where the time is strictly between the two given values.,
Math,Algebra,Linear inequalities in one or two variables,Easy,"A gym membership costs $\$30$ per month plus a one-time sign-up fee of $\$50$. A person wants to spend at most $\$200$ in total. Which inequality represents the number of months, $m$, they can be a member?",$30m \leq 200$,$50m + 30 \leq 200$,$30m + 50 \geq 200$,$30m + 50 \leq 200$,D,,"First, identify the variable costs and fixed costs. The monthly cost is a variable cost, and the sign-up fee is a fixed, one-time cost.",The total cost for $m$ months is the sum of the total monthly fees and the sign-up fee. The total monthly fee is $30m$.,The total cost is the sum of the monthly fees and the sign-up fee: $30m + 50$.,"The person wants to spend 'at most' $\$200$, which means the total cost must be less than or equal to 200.","Therefore, the inequality that represents this situation is $30m + 50 \leq 200$.",
