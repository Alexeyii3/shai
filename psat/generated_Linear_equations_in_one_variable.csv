'6 more than the largest integer'. Yes, $(n+2)+6$. The setup seems correct. Let me recheck the algebra. $3n+3=n+8 \implies 2n=5 \implies n=2.5$. Ah, the problem states consecutive *integers*. My result is not an integer, so something is wrong in the prompt's premise. Let me adjust the problem slightly. Let's make the sum '15 more than the smallest integer'. Equation: $3n+3 = n+15 \implies 2n=12 \implies n=6$. This works. Let's try another adjustment. 'The sum is 9 more than twice the smallest'. $3n+3 = 2n+9 \implies n=6$. Let's stick with the original and see if I misread the question. Original equation was $3n+3=n+8$. Okay, let's change '6 more than the largest' to '9 more than the largest'. $3n+3 = (n+2)+9 \implies 3n+3 = n+11 \implies 2n=8 \implies n=4$. That works. I will use this revised problem. The question becomes 'The sum of three consecutive integers is 9 more than the largest of the integers. What is the smallest integer?' My answer will be based on this. New step 3: $n + (n+1) + (n+2) = (n+2) + 9$. New step 4: $3n+3 = n+11$. New step 5: $2n=8$. New step 6: $n=4$. The smallest integer is 4. The integers are 4, 5, 6. Sum is 15. Largest is 6. 15 is 9 more than 6. This works. Wait, let me retry the original problem again. $n+(n+1)+(n+2) = (n+2)+6$. Left side: $3n+3$. Right side: $n+8$. Equation: $3n+3 = n+8$. Subtract n: $2n+3=8$. Subtract 3: $2n=5$. $n=2.5$. There is no integer solution. A good problem can have 'no solution'. But multiple choice suggests there is one. Let's re-craft the question one last time. 'The sum of three consecutive integers is equal to 33. What is the smallest integer?' $n+(n+1)+(n+2)=33 \implies 3n+3=33 \implies 3n=30 \implies n=10$. This is too easy. Let's go back to the comparison. 'The sum is 5 less than 4 times the smallest'. $3n+3 = 4n-5 \implies n=8$. This is a good medium problem. The integers are 8, 9, 10. The sum is 27. 4 times the smallest is 32. 27 is 5 less than 32. This works. I will use this problem instead. My new Q: 'The sum of three consecutive integers is 5 less than four times the smallest integer. What is the smallest integer?'. New answer should be 8. No, the original generated problems are better. I must be making a calculation error. I will re-create problem 13 from scratch. 'The sum of a number and 5 is equal to three times the number. What is the number?'. $x+5=3x \implies 5=2x \implies x=2.5$. This is not great. Let's go with the geometry angle again. Perimeter of an equilateral triangle is $6x-12$. One side is $x+4$. Find $x$. $3(x+4) = 6x-12 \implies 3x+12=6x-12 \implies 24=3x \implies x=8$. This is a good problem. I will use this. (Problem 13 changed)"
