The slope of the second line is $m_2 = -\rac{k}{8}$. Its y-intercept is $\rac{12}{8} = \rac{3}{2}$.,"For the lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. So, we set $m_1 = m_2$: $\rac{3}{4} = -\rac{k}{8}$. To solve for $k$, multiply both sides by 8: $8(\rac{3}{4}) = -k \implies 6 = -k \implies k = -6$. Since the y-intercepts (-2 and 3/2) are different, the system has no solution when $k=-6$."
